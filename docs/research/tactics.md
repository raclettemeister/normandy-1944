# Tactical Research — Small-Unit WWII Procedures

**Purpose:** WWII-era small-unit tactics that map to the game’s decision space: fire and maneuver, clearing buildings, defense, patrols, ambush, aid stations. Used to judge tactical tiers and to write plausible outcomes.

---

## 1. Fire and Maneuver (Movement Under Fire)

- **Principle:** One element suppresses (fixes the enemy) while another moves. Then roles reverse. Standing in the open without suppression = suicidal.
- **In game:** Decisions that “rush across open ground” or “advance without covering fire” → reckless/suicidal. “BAR/MG on that wall; rest move in bounds” → sound/excellent.
- **Suppression:** Automatic weapons (BAR, MG) are the primary suppressive asset. Riflemen add volume. Suppression is not “everyone shoots at once” — it’s sustained, aimed fire at known or suspected positions so the enemy keeps their head down.
- **Bounding:** Fire team A moves while team B covers; then B moves while A covers. Distances short (one hedgerow, one street). In game: “move in bounds” / “leapfrog” = sound. “Everyone run” = mediocre or worse.

## 2. Building Clearing

- **Entry:** Avoid silhouetting in doors/windows. Toss grenade, then enter quickly (don’t wait in the open). Multiple entry points if possible to split enemy attention.
- **Rooms:** “Clear the corners.” One man covers, one moves. Cellars: grenade down the stairs, then clear. Don’t bunch in doorways.
- **In game:** “Send one man through the door” = reckless. “Grenade then two men, one left one right, BAR covering the stairs” = sound/excellent. Medic leading the stack = bad personnel (medic at risk).

## 3. Defensive Preparation

- **Fields of fire:** Clear lanes; know where the enemy can approach. BAR/MG on likely avenues. No dead space immediately in front if avoidable.
- **Positions:** Foxholes, not standing in the open. Mutual support between positions. Fallback position if the first is overrun.
- **Listening posts / outposts:** Early warning; withdraw on contact or signal. Don’t leave them unsupported.
- **In game:** “Dig in, BAR on the road, listening posts forward” = excellent. “Everyone in the barn” = mediocre (one grenade, one loss). Prep phase (Act 3) maps to this: defensive positions, listening posts, ammo redistribution, aid station, rest/brief.

## 4. Patrol Formations

- **Column:** Fast movement, poor security. Use on friendly or secured routes.
- **Wedge / V:** Better all-around security; slower. Good for approach or uncertain terrain.
- **Line:** Assault or final approach; everyone can fire forward.
- **Point man:** One man (or pair) ahead. First to make contact; should be alert, not the medic or the only NCO. In game: “Doyle (green) on point” = personnel risk. “Webb (sharpshooter/scrounger) on point” = good fit.

---

## 5. Ambush

- **L- or linear ambush:** Kill zone enfiladed by automatic fire. Initiate at short range (e.g. when patrol is in the kill zone). Withdrawal plan if things go wrong.
- **In game:** “Set up both sides of the road, BAR and rifles, wait for them to pass the marker” = sound/excellent. “Charge them when we see them” = reckless. Who is on the trigger (BAR vs rifle) and who is in the kill zone (scout/point) = personnel evaluation.

---

## 6. Aid Station / Casualty Handling

- **Location:** Defilade from direct fire; recognizable (e.g. building, red cross if safe). One or two medics; others bring wounded to them.
- **Medic role:** Triage, stop bleeding, stabilize. Not a front-line fighter; losing the medic hurts all future casualties. In game: medic on point or in the assault stack = personnel penalty.
- **Evacuation:** Plan to move wounded to rear when possible. In game: “medical station” prep and “evacuation plan” support morale and survival.

---

## 7. Communication & Command

- **Radio:** SCR-300 (backpack), SCR-536 (handie-talkie). Critical for calling for fire, reporting, link-up. Losing the radioman = capability loss (hasRadio).
- **Voice / runner:** When radio is out, runners or short verbal orders. NCOs execute; officer/commander decides and coordinates.
- **In game:** “Radioman in the lead” = risk to capability. “Radio at the CP, NCOs forward” = sound.

## 8. Mapping to Game Mechanics

| Game concept | Tactical reality |
|--------------|------------------|
| **requiresCapability (canSuppress)** | Suppressive fire from BAR/MG before movement. |
| **requiresCapability (canScout)** | Point man / recon; someone with good eyes and nerves. |
| **requiresCapability (canTreatWounded)** | Medic in position to receive casualties, not in the assault. |
| **minMen** | Minimum bodies for the task (e.g. clearing a building, carrying wounded). |
| **benefitsFromIntel** | Using map, patrol route, or MG position to choose approach. |
| **Prep (defensive positions, listening posts, ammo, medical, rest)** | Standard defensive prep before expected counterattack. |

Use this doc to justify tier wording in content: “sound” = follows these procedures; “reckless” = ignores suppression or proper roles; “masterful” = procedures + right personnel + intel + contingencies.
