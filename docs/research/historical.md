# Historical Research — 101st Airborne D-Day

**Purpose:** Ground the game’s 30 scenes in real 101st Airborne operations on June 5–6, 1944. Timeline, terrain, unit composition, and hour-by-hour events that inform Act 1–3.

---

## 1. Unit & Drop Plan

- **101st Airborne Division** (Screaming Eagles): part of US VII Corps; mission to secure the southern flank of Utah Beach (causeways, locks, Carentan area).
- **506th PIR** (Parachute Infantry Regiment): Band of Brothers regiment; 3 battalions, each with 3 rifle companies. A typical **rifle company** had ~140 men; a **platoon** ~40, but after the drop often much smaller (scattered sticks).
- **Drop Zones:** DZ C (506th) south of Hiesville; many sticks landed in flooded areas (Marais/Vierville), off DZ, or in the Merderet. Scatter meant “rallies” and ad-hoc groups (captain + NCO + handful of troopers) were the norm for hours.
- **Equipment:** M1 Garand, M1 carbine, BAR, .30 cal MG, grenades, Gammon bombs, Bangalore torpedoes. Radios (SCR-536 “handie-talkie”, SCR-300) often lost or damaged on the drop.

## 2. Timeline (June 5–6, 1944)

| Time (approx.) | Event (101st / general) |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **~0100** | First pathfinders on the ground (mark DZ). Main serials cross the Channel. |
| **~0100–0130** | Main drop. C-47s under flak; many pilots evaded, drops scattered. Troopers land in fields, hedgerows, water. |
| **0100–0300** | **Solo/small-group phase.** Troopers orient (often lost), check gear, avoid fire, look for friendlies. “Clicker” crickets for IFF. First contacts: other Americans or Germans. |
| **0300–0500** | **Rally phase.** NCOs and officers gather stragglers. Small groups coalesce at rally points (often pre-briefed: “near the church,” “south of the DZ”). First serious firefights (patrols, MG positions). |
| **0500–0600** | Dawn. Units move toward objectives (causeways, bridges, villages). 506th objectives included causeway exits (1–4), St-Côme-du-Mont, Carentan approaches. |
| **0600–1200** | **Assault / consolidation.** Fighting for crossroads, strongpoints, buildings. German counterattacks begin. Aid stations, ammo redistribution, defensive setups. |
| **1200–2400** | Hold positions, repel counterattacks, link up with seaborne forces. Relief and resupply from Utah. |

**In-game mapping:** Act 1 ≈ 0100–0600 (landing, orientation, rally, first fights). Act 2 ≈ dawn through midday (assault, buildings, MG nests). Act 3 ≈ consolidation, prep, counterattack, relief.

## 3. Terrain & Conditions

- **Bocage:** Hedgerows (earth banks + trees/shrubs), narrow roads, limited fields of fire. Ideal for ambush and defense; movement is channeled.
- **Flooded areas (marais):** Merderet and tributaries; many DZs bordered or intersected by water. Troopers landed in water, lost equipment, drowned. Movement required causeways or bridges.
- **Villages:** Stone buildings, church steeples (OPs), cellars. Strongpoints at crossroads and in key buildings.
- **Weather:** Cloud, mist, some moonlight; visibility variable. No heavy rain on the night of 5/6.
- **Time pressure:** Link up with seaborne forces and secure objectives before German reinforcement. Delays cost lives and ground.

## 4. Specific Battles & Locations (for scene color)

- **Sainte-Mère-Église** (82nd): Often referenced; 101st was south, but similar “village at night” and MG-in-church imagery.
- **Causeways (exits 1–4):** Critical for Utah Beach; 101st had to secure them. Bridges and raised roads over marsh = chokepoints.
- **St-Côme-du-Mont / Carentan:** 101st objectives; later fierce fighting (e.g. “Bloody Gulch”). Good reference for “approach to a defended town” and “holding against counterattack.”
- **Marais / flooded fields:** Drowning, lost equipment, disorientation. “Landed in water” is a recurring 101st experience.
- **Hiesville / scattered DZ:** Many 506th sticks landed near Hiesville; rally points and first contacts in hedgerows and farm tracks.

---

## 5. Unit Composition (platoon-level)

- **Typical rifle platoon (paper):** 1 LT (platoon leader), 1 platoon sergeant (e.g. “Top”), 3–4 squads; each squad with NCO, BAR, riflemen. Medics and radiomen attached at company level, often one per platoon in practice.
- **Reality post-drop:** Ad-hoc groups. Captain or senior NCO might have 5–15 men from multiple units. Roles (BAR, medic, radio) matter more than original squad roster. Game’s 18-man roster and “rally” mechanics match this.

---

## 6. Hour-by-Hour (for scene pacing)

- **0100–0115:** In the air / chute down / landing. Gear check, cut harness, orient. **Scene: The Landing.**
- **0115–0145:** Move toward rally or objective. First “friend or foe” contacts. **Scenes: Finding North, First Contact.**
- **0145–0230:** Find first stragglers, meet NCO (e.g. platoon sergeant). Small firefights possible. **Scenes: The Straggler, The Sergeant, The Patrol.**
- **0230–0400:** Farmhouses, crossroads, possible MG or patrol. Building a real “squad.” **Scenes: Farmhouse, Crossroad, Minefield.**
- **0400–0600:** Rally point, challenge/password, consolidation. **Scene: The Rally Point.**
- **0600+:** Dawn, movement to objective, assault phase. **Act 2.**
- **Post-assault:** Defensive prep, counterattack, relief. **Act 3.**

## 7. Sources & Notes

- Ambrose, *Band of Brothers*; 506th PIR accounts.
- 101st after-action reports and unit histories (D-Day objectives, timelines).
- Maps: DZ locations, causeways, St-Côme-du-Mont, Carentan.

**Use for game:** Pick concrete details (crickets, flooded fields, causeways, hedgerows, “Top,” BAR teams) and plausible times. Avoid over-claiming historical accuracy; aim for **authentic feel** so scenes read true to 101st D-Day.
