# Act 1 Scene 9 — The Minefield

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene09_minefield`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene10_rally_point`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Flooded pasture. Possible mines (marked or unmarked). Slow, careful movement vs speed vs bypass.
- **Threats:** Mines; delay (time pressure toward rally); possible enemy observation. Losses here hurt because the player now knows the squad.
- **Time:** ~0300–0320.
- **Weather:** Night; wet ground.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Run through the pasture; or send someone across to "test." |
| **Reckless** | Rush without probing or bypass consideration. |
| **Mediocre** | "Go around" with no plan; or "cross" with no method. |
| **Sound** | Probe with bayonet or stick; or bypass and accept time cost. Single file, careful. |
| **Excellent** | Clear path or bypass; designate who leads (veteran or steady), rest follow in trace. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: veteran/steady in lead (Washington, Henderson); green (Doyle, Ellis) in the middle, not probing. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Probing / lead:** Ideal: veteran, steady (Washington, Henderson). **Personnel hook:** Doyle or Ellis (green) probing = high risk (trait trigger: freeze or panic). Rivera (medic) probing = capability risk.
- **minMen:** "Need at least two — one to probe, one to cover." At least 2 decisions with minMen, requiresPhase, or explicit role (who goes first).
- **Consequences:** Losses here should feel personal; narrative can name who was hit and why (wrong man in front).

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Crossed without loss, time ~20 min. Possible morale bump (we did it right).
- **Partial:** Crossed with delay or one casualty (wounded); time cost.
- **Failure:** Casualty (KIA or wounded); morale hit; possible capability loss if key soldier (e.g. medic) hit.

## Rally soldiers

- No new rally this scene. Full squad from previous scenes.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "We don't run. We probe. I'll take the lead — you keep the interval. Doyle, you're in the middle."
- **Green fallback:** "One step at a time. Nobody moves till I say."

---

## Tone notes

- Dread and discipline. One wrong step. Second person present. Death or wounding clinical, not graphic. Names matter now.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Crossroad.
- **After:** The Rally Point — American voices, challenge/response; arrival and remaining rally events.
