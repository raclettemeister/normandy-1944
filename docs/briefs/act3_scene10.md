# Act 3 Scene 10 — Relief

**Scene ID:** `act3_scene10_relief`  
**Next default:** End of game (epilogue).

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Crossroads. 4th Infantry (or relief force) arrives — or doesn't (if position was lost). Resolution.
- **Threats:** None. Assessment: who lived, what was achieved, what was lost.
- **Time:** End of D-Day or next day.
- **Weather:** Day.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | N/A (resolution). |
| **Reckless** | N/A. |
| **Mediocre** | Vague "we made it" with no assessment. |
| **Sound** | Relief linked; count the living; crossroads held (or not). |
| **Excellent** | Same + names; who's wounded, who's gone; what the platoon accomplished. |
| **Masterful** | Same + emotional weight without melodrama; relationships (Kowalski–Novak, Henderson–Doyle, etc.) land if relevant; bridge to epilogue. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Assessment:** Who's left; who's wounded; who didn't make it. **Personnel hook:** Can reference roster (minMen as "how many made it"); capability (canTreatWounded, hasRadio) for survivors.
- **Epilogue setup:** Each soldier gets an epilogue; relationships and traits inform it.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Relief arrived; position held; campaign success. Epilogue triggers.
- **Partial:** Relief arrived but position was costly; or relief delayed.
- **Failure:** Position lost; relief too late; or campaign failure (fatal earlier). Epilogue still runs for survivors.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Survivors only.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "They're here. We held. Let's get the wounded out and count the cost."
- **Green fallback:** "Relief's here. We made it."

---

## Tone notes

- Resolution. Restrained. Who lived, who didn't. Second person present. No Hollywood; bridge to epilogue (soldier-by-soldier).

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Main Assault.
- **After:** End game; epilogue (soldier fates); run summary.
