## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Throw grenade without looking; or ignore non-combatants. |
| **Reckless** | Rush down the stairs; no check. |
| **Mediocre** | "Check it" with no method; or freeze. |
| **Sound** | Grenade or flash, then clear; identify who's down there; handle POWs/civilians by the book. |
| **Excellent** | Same + secure the stairs; one or two men down, rest covering; clear rules of engagement. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: steady/veteran down first (Washington, Park); Bergman if German speakers needed; medic ready for wounded. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Who goes down:** Ideal: veteran, steady. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen, or role (who leads, who covers). **Bergman:** benefitsFromIntel or "speaks German" if POWs/civilians.
- **Medic:** Rivera on standby for wounded.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Cellar secured; intel, cache, or narrative beat (POWs/civilians). Time ~15–20 min.
- **Partial:** Secured with complication (wounded, delay).
- **Failure:** Casualties, booby trap, or moral failure.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "One man down, one covering. Washington, you're steady — take a look. Rest of you hold the stairs."
- **Green fallback:** "We do this by the book. Identify before we do anything."

---

## Tone notes

- Dark, stairs, one light. Tension. Second person present. Moral weight without melodrama.

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Building.
- **After:** The Counterfire — enemy mortar on your position.
