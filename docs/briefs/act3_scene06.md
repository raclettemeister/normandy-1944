**Scene ID:** Part of preparation menu (prep id `find_stragglers`)  
**Engine:** Time cost 60 min. Effect: additionalMen 3.

## Tactical situation

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Skip or send one man into the unknown. |
| **Reckless** | Big patrol, no security; noisy. |
| **Mediocre** | "Look for men" with no route or method. |
| **Sound** | Small patrol (2–3), route and return time; challenge/counter-sign. |
| **Excellent** | Same + right personnel (veteran or steady lead; scout types). |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Washington or Park leading; Webb/Jenkins for eyes; not Doyle/Ellis alone. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Patrol lead:** Veteran or NCO (Washington, Park, Malone). **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen, requiresCapability (canScout), or "who goes."
- **Scouts:** Webb, Jenkins. **Green:** Doyle, Ellis — risk if on patrol without steady lead.

## State changes

- **On completion:** totalTimePreparing +60. additionalMen 3 (narrative/mechanical). Counterattack trigger check.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Washington, take two and sweep the hedgerows. Be back in an hour. Use the password."
- **Green fallback:** "Small patrol. Find anybody else. Don't get lost."

---

## Tone notes

- Patrol, hedgerows, hope for more men. Second person present. Missing prep = fewer rifles in counterattack.
