|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Everyone charges at once; no fire support. |
| **Reckless** | Assault without base of fire or with wrong timing. |
| **Mediocre** | "Attack" with no split of roles. |
| **Sound** | Base of fire + assault; clear sectors; NCOs lead elements. |
| **Excellent** | Same + timing (fire lifts when assault moves); use of intel (knowsMGPosition). |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: right NCOs leading assault; BAR supporting; medic and radio protected; green in support. |
