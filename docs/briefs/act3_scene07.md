## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Skip or no rest, no brief. |
| **Reckless** | Everybody sleeps; no watch. |
| **Mediocre** | "Rest" with no rotation; brief vague. |
| **Sound** | Sleep shifts; NCOs briefed on sectors and fallback. |
| **Excellent** | Same + Henderson, Malone, Park each know their sector and the overall plan. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: 2IC (Henderson) runs the brief; green (Doyle, Ellis) get rest so they're sharp; everyone knows the password. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Brief:** Henderson leads. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen or "who briefs whom."
- **Rest rotation:** Fair split; NCOs and veteran get others to rest.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Half of you sleep, half watch. Red, Park — we brief in twenty. Everybody knows their sector and the fallback."
- **Green fallback:** "Rest in shifts. NCOs get the brief. Then we hold."

## Tone notes

- Calm, short respite. Second person present. Missing prep = fatigue and confusion in counterattack.
