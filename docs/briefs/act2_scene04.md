# Act 2 Scene 4 — The MG Nest

**Scene ID:** `act2_scene04_mg_nest`  
**Next default:** `act2_scene05_the_assault`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Approach to crossroads. MG-42 covering the approach. Must suppress and flank — the core tactical lesson.
- **Threats:** Direct assault = slaughter. Need base of fire + assault element.
- **Time:** ~0650–0720.
- **Weather:** Dawn.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Charge the MG head-on. |
| **Reckless** | Rush without suppression or with wrong personnel on the gun. |
| **Mediocre** | "Attack the MG" with no plan. |
| **Sound** | BAR/MG suppresses; assault element flanks. Two elements, coordinated. |
| **Excellent** | Base of fire (Kowalski + support), assault (Malone/Park + riflemen); timing. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Kowalski on BAR (canSuppress); not Rivera. Assault lead: NCO or veteran. Green in support, not leading. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Base of fire:** Kowalski (BAR), Novak (ammo). **Personnel hook:** requiresCapability canSuppress; if BAR gunner down, capability lost. 2+ decisions with requiresCapability, minMen, or who leads assault.
- **Assault element:** Malone, Park, Washington. Not Doyle/Ellis leading. **Medic:** Rivera in rear, not in assault.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** MG neutralized, ammo spent (suppression), time ~30 min. Possible casualties (partial) even on success.
- **Partial:** MG suppressed but not destroyed; or casualties.
- **Failure:** Heavy casualties; possible loss of BAR or medic.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Kowalski, you and Novak pin that gun. Red, take four and flank left. Nobody moves till the BAR is firing."
- **Green fallback:** "Suppress first. Then we flank. Don't run at the gun."

---

## Tone notes

- The core lesson: suppression, then movement. Concrete: tracers, movement, one or two names. Second person present.
