# Act 3 Scene 1 — Taking Stock

**Scene ID:** `act3_scene01_taking_stock`  
**Next default:** Preparation menu (scenes 2–7; player chooses order)

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Crossroads held. You have time before the counterattack. Resource assessment: men, ammo, wounded, capabilities.
- **Threats:** Counterattack will come (trigger by time/readiness). What you do now determines outcome then.
- **Time:** ~1000+. Preparation phase begins.
- **Weather:** Day.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Ignore gaps; do nothing. |
| **Reckless** | Rush one prep, ignore the rest. |
| **Mediocre** | Vague "get ready" with no priority. |
| **Sound** | Assess: what we have, what we lack. Pick first prep(s) with reason. |
| **Excellent** | Clear priority: defensive positions first, then ammo/medical; use time wisely. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: NCOs assigned to prep tasks; Rivera for medical; Kowalski for BAR position; time budget in mind. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Assessment:** Henderson reports; NCOs (Malone, Park) for sectors. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen or capability (canTreatWounded, canSuppress, hasRadio).
- **Prep ordering:** Which prep first — sets up scenes 2–7 (menu). Player will choose from: Defensive Positions, Listening Posts, Redistribute Ammo, Medical Station, Find Stragglers, Rest and Brief.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Clear picture; player enters preparation menu. Time starts counting for prep phase.
- **Partial:** Assessment done; prep menu available but perhaps rushed.
- **Failure:** Poor assessment; gaps carry into counterattack.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Platoon (minus casualties) from Act 2.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "We've got maybe a few hours. They'll hit us. I'd start with the positions — then ammo, then doc. Your call, Captain."
- **Green fallback:** "We need to dig in, then sort ammo. What do you want first?"

---

## Tone notes

- Calm before the storm. Concrete: numbers, gaps, one or two names. Second person present. Menu choice is the key mechanic.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** Act 2 — First Light.
- **After:** Preparation menu (player picks preps; each has time cost; counterattack can trigger when trigger hour reached).
