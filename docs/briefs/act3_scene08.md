# Act 3 Scene 8 — The Counterattack Begins

**Scene ID:** `act3_scene08_counterattack_begins`  
**Next default:** `act3_scene09_main_assault`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Crossroads. German probing attack. Everything prepared (or not) matters now. Counterattack trigger has fired (time + readiness).
- **Threats:** Probing forces; if earlyWarning (listening posts) was done, player gets warning. If not, enemy hits without notice. Prep effects apply: casualtyReduction, earlyWarning, ammoRedistributed, medicalReady, moraleBonus, additionalMen.
- **Time:** Trigger hour (e.g. 14:00–16:00 depending on readiness).
- **Weather:** Day.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Break position; charge out. |
| **Reckless** | No discipline; everyone shoots at once; no reserves. |
| **Mediocre** | React late or with no plan. |
| **Sound** | Hold sectors; BAR on approach; listening posts fall back (if they existed); wounded to aid station. |
| **Excellent** | Same + use prep: early warning gave time; positions hold; ammo and medical ready. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Kowalski on BAR; NCOs in sector; Rivera at aid station; missing preps show as gaps (no warning, ammo short, etc.). |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Sectors:** Who holds (Henderson, Malone, Park). **BAR:** Kowalski (Novak). **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with requiresCapability, minMen, or prep consequences (narrative: "we didn't set listening posts — they're on us before we know it").
- **Missing prep consequences:** Visible in narrative (no early warning, ammo crisis, wounded with no plan, low morale).

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Probe repelled; prep effects reduce casualties. Ammo spent. Time advances.
- **Partial:** Repelled with casualties; or position stressed.
- **Failure:** Gaps overrun; significant casualties; possible fallback.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Platoon (prep may have added stragglers).

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Here they come. Hold your sectors. Kowalski — wait till they're in the kill zone."
- **Green fallback:** "Hold the line. Don't break. Doc's in the cellar."

---

## Tone notes

- Probing attack. Prep pays off or its absence hurts. Second person present. Concrete: tracers, sectors, one or two names.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** Preparation phase (counterattack trigger fired).
- **After:** The Main Assault — full German counterattack.
