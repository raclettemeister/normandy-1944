# Act 1 Scene 4 — The Straggler

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene04_straggler`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene05_sergeant`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Same as First Contact or a short move. A scared private from another unit (e.g. 502nd) — first follower.
- **Threats:** Low immediate threat. Risk: leaving him behind or mishandling him (panic, noise, desertion).
- **Time:** ~0145–0200.
- **Weather:** Night.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Abandon him in a dangerous spot or threaten him. |
| **Reckless** | Order him on point or ignore his state; no calm. |
| **Mediocre** | "Come with me" with no leadership; or ignore him. |
| **Sound** | Calm him, give a simple task (follow, stay quiet), keep him close. |
| **Excellent** | Brief reassurance, clear role ("you're with me"), check his weapon. |
| **Masterful** | Turn him into an asset: calm, one clear order, make him feel part of the team. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **First scene with a follower.** Player doesn't assign from roster yet — the straggler is a generic NPC. Decisions can still have **minMen** (e.g. "need at least one other man to move") or **requiresPhase** to set up later personnel rules.
- **Personnel hooks:** At least 2 decisions with minMen, requiresPhase, or similar so that "who does what" or "how many" matters for future scenes.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** +1 effective man (straggler follows), morale slight bump, time ~15 min.
- **Partial:** He follows but shaky; or time cost.
- **Failure:** He runs, freezes, or narrative consequence; possible morale loss.

---

## Rally soldiers

- **None from platoon roster.** Straggler is from another unit (NPC). Rally table for later scenes starts at Scene 5 (Henderson, Malone, Doyle).

---

## 2IC comments

- **N/A.** No 2IC yet. Optional: internal voice or short self-dialogue ("You need him steady. One more set of eyes.").

---

## Tone notes

- Leadership tone: calm, direct. No "weight of command." Second person present. Show his fear and your response in action, not metaphor.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** First Contact (friend identified).
- **After:** The Sergeant — Henderson, Malone, Doyle behind a wall; squad starts to form.
