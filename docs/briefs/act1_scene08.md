# Act 1 Scene 8 — The Crossroad

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene08_crossroad`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene09_minefield`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Road crossing. Wire across the road (obstacle or signal). Fresh tire tracks — vehicles passed recently.
- **Threats:** Route choice: safe/slow (hedgerows, longer) vs fast/exposed (road). Wrong choice = time loss, ambush, or contact with armor.
- **Time:** ~0245–0300.
- **Weather:** Night.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Deliberately take the road at speed in the open. |
| **Reckless** | Rush down the road without scout or flank security. |
| **Mediocre** | "Go that way" with no reasoning; or freeze at the wire. |
| **Sound** | Weigh options: tracks = recent activity; wire = possible obstacle or trap. Choose route (bypass or cross) with security. |
| **Excellent** | Scout the wire, read the tracks; pick route and formation (e.g. point man, interval). |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: who scouts the wire (Webb/Jenkins if present; not Doyle), who covers; use intel (hasMap) if available. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Point / scout:** Ideal: sharpshooter or veteran (Webb, Washington). Poor: Doyle (green), Rivera (medic). **Personnel hook:** at least 2 decisions with minMen, benefitsFromIntel (hasMap), or "who scouts."
- **Henderson / Malone:** Coordinate movement; NCO on point or covering.
- **Kowalski:** BAR covering the crossroad while others move.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Safe passage, time cost depends on route (~15–20 min). Possibly intel (observe without contact).
- **Partial:** Slow progress or minor contact; time cost.
- **Failure:** Contact, casualties, or significant time loss.

---

## Rally soldiers

- No new rally this scene. Squad is Henderson, Malone, Doyle, Rivera, Kowalski, possibly straggler.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Those tracks are fresh. We go around — ditch and hedgerow. Kowalski, keep us covered till we're across."
- **Green fallback:** "Don't like the road. Let's find another way."

---

## Tone notes

- Tension: wire, tracks, choice. Short sentences. Second person present. No metaphor.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Farmhouse.
- **After:** The Minefield — flooded pasture; mines? Risk assessment.
