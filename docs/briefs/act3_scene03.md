**Engine:** Time cost 60 min. Effect: earlyWarning true.

- **Time cost:** 60 min.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Skip or put no one out. |
| **Reckless** | One man, no relief or signal plan. |
| **Mediocre** | "Put someone out" with no plan. |
| **Sound** | Two posts (e.g. east, west); signal to fall back; relief plan. |
| **Excellent** | Same + right personnel (Webb, Jenkins, Mitchell — quiet, good eyes). |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: sharpshooters/scroungers on posts; Caruso not on post (loud); clear challenge/counter-sign. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Who goes out:** Ideal Webb, Jenkins, Mitchell (quiet, sharpshooter). Poor Caruso (loud_mouth). **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen, requiresCapability (canScout), or "who's on the posts."
- **Prompting:** "Webb and Mitchell — you're our eyes. Stay quiet, stay sharp. Two clicks means fall back."

---

## State changes

- **On completion:** totalTimePreparing +60. earlyWarning true. Counterattack trigger check.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Webb, Mitchell — listening posts. One east, one west. Don't get caught. Two clicks and you come in."
- **Green fallback:** "Two men out. Watch the approaches. Signal if you see anything."

---

## Tone notes

- Quiet, watchful. Second person present. Missing prep = no early warning in scene 8/9.
