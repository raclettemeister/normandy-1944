# Act 3 Scene 4 — Preparation: Redistribute Ammo

**Scene ID:** Part of preparation menu (prep id `redistribute_ammo`)  
**Engine:** Time cost 30 min. Effect: ammoRedistributed true.

---

## Tactical situation

- **Activity:** Pool and rebalance ammunition. Everyone has enough for the fight.
- **Threats:** Time cost. Not doing it = ammo shortage during counterattack (narrative and possibly mechanical).
- **Time cost:** 30 min.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Skip or waste ammo. |
| **Reckless** | Give everyone equal without regard to role (BAR needs more). |
| **Mediocre** | "Share ammo" with no system. |
| **Sound** | Pool, then redistribute: BAR gets priority, then riflemen. |
| **Excellent** | Same + Kowalski/Novak have enough belts; riflemen have clips. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Novak (BAR ammo bearer) and Kowalski coordinated; scroungers (Webb, Jenkins) help find extra. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **BAR ammo:** Kowalski, Novak. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen or "who carries what."
- **Scroungers:** Webb, Jenkins can narratively find extra (trait).

---

## State changes

- **On completion:** totalTimePreparing +30. ammoRedistributed true. Counterattack trigger check.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Pool it. Kowalski and Novak get first claim — then the rest of us. Nobody fights with an empty weapon."
- **Green fallback:** "Share the ammo. BAR first. Then everybody else."

---

## Tone notes

- Practical, numbers. Second person present. Missing prep = ammo crisis in counterattack.
