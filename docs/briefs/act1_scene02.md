## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Deliberately move toward known enemy or into open fire. |
| **Reckless** | Move at speed without checking compass or stars; no plan. |
| **Mediocre** | "Go north" with no method; or stay put with no decision. |
| **Sound** | Use compass or stars (Polaris), pick a bearing, move deliberately. |
| **Excellent** | Navigate by terrain + compass/stars; short bounds; avoid skyline. |
| **Masterful** | Clear method (e.g. "Polaris, then hedge line"), efficient pace, minimal exposure. |
