## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Shoot without identifying, or shout and wave. |
| **Reckless** | Move toward silhouette without IFF procedure. |
| **Mediocre** | Vague "check who it is" with no method. |
| **Sound** | Use clicker (cricket) or challenge/password (Flash/Thunder); wait for response before moving. |
| **Excellent** | IFF from cover, clear sequence, weapon ready until confirmed. |
| **Masterful** | Textbook IFF: cover, clicker, then approach only if friend. |
