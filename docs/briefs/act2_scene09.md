# Act 2 Scene 9 — Securing the Position

**Scene ID:** `act2_scene09_securing`  
**Next default:** `act2_scene10_first_light`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** You hold the crossroads. Immediate defensive setup: fields of fire, positions, BAR/MG placement.
- **Threats:** Counterattack expected. Poor setup = losses when it comes. Foreshadow Act 3.
- **Time:** ~0900–0930.
- **Weather:** Morning.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | No positions; everyone in the open. |
| **Reckless** | Bunch in one building; no fields of fire. |
| **Mediocre** | "Dig in" with no plan; no sectors. |
| **Sound** | Sectors assigned; BAR on likely approach; foxholes or cover; mutual support. |
| **Excellent** | Same + listening post or outpost; ammo redistributed; medic position. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Kowalski on key avenue; NCOs in each sector; Rivera at aid point; clear fallback. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Sectors:** Who holds where. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen, requiresCapability (canSuppress), or "who covers which approach."
- **BAR:** Kowalski (Novak ammo) on main avenue. **Medic:** Rivera at aid point. **Listening post:** Webb, Jenkins, or Mitchell.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Position secured; morale +; time ~30 min. Ready for Act 3 (prep phase).
- **Partial:** Secured but gaps or fatigue.
- **Failure:** Poor positions; will hurt in counterattack (narrative consequence in Act 3).

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Kowalski, that wall — cover the road. I want listening posts out. Doc, set up in the cellar. Everybody else — dig in, know your sector."
- **Green fallback:** "Everybody has a sector. BAR on the main approach. Hold what we've got."

---

## Tone notes

- Consolidation. Shovels, sectors, one or two names. Second person present. Transition to defensive mindset.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Counterfire.
- **After:** First Light — position secured; assessment; transition to Act 3.
