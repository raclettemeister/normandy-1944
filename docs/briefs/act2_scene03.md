# Act 2 Scene 3 — The Observation Post

**Scene ID:** `act2_scene03_observation_post`  
**Next default:** `act2_scene04_mg_nest`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Hill or high ground overlooking objective (crossroads). Recon opportunity.
- **Threats:** Exposure if observed; need to observe without being seen. Intel flags determine options later (MG position, patrol route, etc.).
- **Time:** ~0630–0650.
- **Weather:** Dawn.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Stand in the open on the crest. |
| **Reckless** | Rush to the top without security or concealment. |
| **Mediocre** | "Look at the objective" with no method. |
| **Sound** | Crawl to position, observe, note MG positions and routes; withdraw without being seen. |
| **Excellent** | Same + assign observer (sharpshooter or veteran), security element; report back clearly. |
| **Masterful** | Same + use personnel: Webb/Mitchell/Jenkins observe; benefitsFromIntel for next scenes (knowsMGPosition, knowsPatrolRoute). |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Observer:** Ideal sharpshooter (Webb, Mitchell, Jenkins) or veteran (Washington). **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with benefitsFromIntel, minMen, or "who goes up."
- **Security:** Who covers the OP; who stays with the main body.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Intel gained (knowsMGPosition, knowsPatrolRoute, etc.). Time ~20 min. No contact.
- **Partial:** Partial intel or observed; possible compromise.
- **Failure:** Spotted, contact, or no intel; time/casualty.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Webb and Mitchell — you're the eyes. Rest of us stay back. Mark anything that moves."
- **Green fallback:** "Two men up. Rest hold. Report what you see."

---

## Tone notes

- Crawl, glass, scribble. Concrete: what they see (MG, vehicles, wire). Second person present.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Approach.
- **After:** The MG Nest — MG-42 covering the approach; suppression + flanking.
