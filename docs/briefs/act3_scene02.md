## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Skip it or "dig somewhere" with no plan. |
| **Reckless** | One position, no mutual support. |
| **Mediocre** | "Dig in" with no sectors or fields of fire. |
| **Sound** | Sectors, BAR on main avenue, foxholes with overlap. |
| **Excellent** | Same + fallback position; NCOs know their sectors. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Kowalski/Novak on BAR position; Henderson/Malone/Park each have a sector; clear lanes of fire. |
