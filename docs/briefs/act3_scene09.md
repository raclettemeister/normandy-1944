# Act 3 Scene 9 — The Main Assault

**Scene ID:** `act3_scene09_main_assault`  
**Next default:** `act3_scene10_relief`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Crossroads. Full German counterattack. Hold or break. All prep effects (casualtyReduction, earlyWarning, ammoRedistributed, medicalReady, moraleBonus, additionalMen) apply.
- **Threats:** Maximum pressure. Missing preps = visible consequences (casualties, ammo dry, wounded lost, morale collapse).
- **Time:** After probe; main push.
- **Weather:** Day.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Abandon position; rout. |
| **Reckless** | Break discipline; no reserves; BAR runs dry (if ammo not redistributed). |
| **Mediocre** | Hold but with gaps; no coordination. |
| **Sound** | Hold sectors; mutual support; fallback if needed; wounded to aid station. |
| **Excellent** | Same + prep effects: positions hold, ammo lasts, medic saves lives, morale holds. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: every sector has an NCO or veteran; Kowalski/Novak hold the BAR; Rivera in the cellar; missing preps narrated as cost (e.g. "we didn't dig in — the casualties are heavy"). |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Full platoon:** Sectors, BAR, medic, 2IC. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with requiresCapability, minMen, or consequence of prep (who's left, who's wounded).
- **Prep consequences:** No defensive positions = casualtyReduction missing. No ammo redistribute = ammo crisis. No medical station = wounded deteriorate. No rest = fatigue. No stragglers = fewer men.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Hold. Heavy cost possible. Prep effects reduce casualties. Time to relief.
- **Partial:** Hold with heavy losses; position barely intact.
- **Failure:** Break; fallback or overrun; possible fatal outcome for the campaign.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Survivors only.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "This is it. Hold the line. Relief's coming — we just have to last."
- **Green fallback:** "Hold. Don't break. Hold."

---

## Tone notes

- Climax. Everything prepared matters. Second person present. Death and wounding clinical. Names matter.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Counterattack Begins.
- **After:** Relief — 4th Infantry arrives (or doesn't); resolution; epilogue.
