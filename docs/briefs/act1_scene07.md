# Act 1 Scene 7 — The Farmhouse

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene07_farmhouse`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene08_crossroad`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Stone building (farmhouse). 506th gear on porch — Americans have been here or dropped nearby. Building may be empty or contested.
- **Threats:** Unknown inside. Clearing a building without procedure = casualties. Need stack, grenade, clear corners.
- **Time:** ~0230–0245.
- **Weather:** Night.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Send one man through the door first; or charge in blind. |
| **Reckless** | Enter without grenade or without covering fire. |
| **Mediocre** | "Clear it" with no method; everyone bunched at the door. |
| **Sound** | Grenade then entry; two men, one left one right; someone covering. |
| **Excellent** | Stack, grenade, clear room by room; BAR or rifle covering the stairs. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: don't put medic (Rivera) or green (Doyle) first in the stack. Designate who goes left/right. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Rivera (medic):** Will be found here (or already with group). **Personnel hook:** Rivera first in stack = bad (medic at risk). Rivera in rear or treating = correct.
- **Kowalski (BAR):** Will be found here. **Personnel hook:** Kowalski covering the approach or stairs = good (canSuppress). Kowalski leading the stack = wrong.
- **Henderson / Malone:** NCOs for leading the stack or covering. At least 2 decisions with requiresCapability (e.g. canSuppress), minMen, or "who goes first."
- **Doyle:** Green — keep out of first entry.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Building cleared. Rivera and Kowalski join (rally). canTreatWounded and canSuppress gained. Ammo spent (grenades, possible firefight). Time ~15–20 min.
- **Partial:** Cleared with delay or minor casualty; capabilities still gained.
- **Failure:** Casualties (narrative: wrong man first?), or building not fully cleared.

## Rally soldiers

- **rivera**, **kowalski** (this scene is their rally). Reference roster IDs.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Grenade, then we go. Doc stays back — we need him in one piece. Kowalski, you're on the door."
- **Green fallback:** "Clear it by the numbers. Medic doesn't go first."

---

## Tone notes

- Confined space, one or two rooms. Concrete: door, corners, stairs. Second person present. No purple prose.

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Patrol.
- **After:** The Crossroad — wire across road, fresh tire tracks; route choice.
