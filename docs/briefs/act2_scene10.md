## Tactical situation

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Ignore casualties or capability gaps. |
| **Reckless** | No count, no plan; assume we're fine. |
| **Mediocre** | "We're good" with no assessment. |
| **Sound** | Count heads, ammo, wounded; identify gaps (medic, BAR, radio). |
| **Excellent** | Same + assign rest or quick prep; NCOs report; plan for counterattack. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: who's wounded, who's capable; Rivera's report; Davis (radio) status; set conditions for prep phase. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Assessment:** Who reports (Henderson, NCOs). **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen or capability check (canTreatWounded, hasRadio, canSuppress).
- **Wounded:** Rivera's count. **Radio:** Davis — link to higher.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Clear picture; morale stable; transition to Act 3 (Taking Stock). Time ~15–20 min.
- **Partial:** Assessment done but rushed or incomplete.
- **Failure:** Missed gaps; will matter in Act 3.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon (minus casualties).

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "We've got the crossroads. Here's what we've got — and here's what we're short. They'll come back. We use the time we have."
- **Green fallback:** "Count the men. Count the ammo. We hold till relief or till they hit us again."

---

## Tone notes
