## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Skip or put medic in the line. |
| **Reckless** | No location; "doc will figure it out." |
| **Mediocre** | "Set up aid" with no plan. |
| **Sound** | Defilade location; Rivera has supplies; evacuation route. |
| **Excellent** | Same + wounded know where to go; one or two men assigned to carry. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Rivera at aid station; Washington or steady men as stretcher-bearers; not Rivera on the line. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Medic:** Rivera. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with requiresCapability (canTreatWounded), minMen, or "who helps doc."
- **Stretcher / runners:** Steady riflemen; not green (Doyle, Ellis) for critical carry.

## State changes

- **On completion:** totalTimePreparing +45. medicalReady true. Counterattack trigger check.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Doc, cellar's your aid station. Everybody — wounded go there. Washington, you're with Doc if we have to move anybody."
- **Green fallback:** "Aid station in the cellar. Doc runs it. Know where it is."

## Tone notes

- Practical, calm. Second person present. Missing prep = wounded pay in counterattack.
