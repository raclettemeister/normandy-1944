# Act 1 Scene 10 — The Rally Point

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene10_rally_point`  
**Next default:** Act 2 opening (e.g. `act2_scene01_dawn`)

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Rally point (pre-briefed or recognized). American voices; challenge and response (password/counter-sign).
- **Threats:** Risk of friendly fire or infiltration if challenge is wrong. Otherwise consolidation — safe for the moment.
- **Time:** ~0320–0400 or to 0600 (end of Act 1).
- **Weather:** Night toward dawn.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Charge in without challenge or give wrong password. |
| **Reckless** | Shout and run toward voices without procedure. |
| **Mediocre** | Vague "answer them" with no sequence. |
| **Sound** | Proper challenge/response; identify before approaching. |
| **Excellent** | Challenge from cover, then approach; bring the squad in order. |
| **Masterful** | Same + ensure everyone knows the password; no one fires; clean link-up. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Who answers the challenge:** Ideally officer or NCO (Henderson). **Personnel hook:** Doyle (green) answering = risk (stumble, wrong word). At least 2 decisions with minMen or role (who speaks, who covers).
- **Squad discipline:** Keep formation; no stray fire. benefitsFromIntel or requiresPhase as needed.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Link-up. Milestone achieved. Remaining rally soldiers can join (from getRallyOrder: park/webb/ellis, davis/caruso, washington/mitchell/sullivan, novak/bergman/jenkins, herrera/palmer). Morale +. Time to end of Act 1.
- **Partial:** Link-up with delay or confusion; some rally soldiers still missing.
- **Failure:** Friendly fire incident, or failed link-up; casualties or morale hit.

## Rally soldiers

- Remaining rally events (after Henderson, Malone, Doyle, Rivera, Kowalski already in): **park**, **webb**, **ellis**; **davis**, **caruso**; **washington**, **mitchell**, **sullivan**; **novak**, **bergman**, **jenkins**; **herrera**, **palmer**. Reference `getRallyOrder()` in `src/engine/roster.ts`. Scene can trigger one or more of these depending on timing/narrative.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Flash. Wait for Thunder. Then we move in. Everybody hold fire."
- **Green fallback:** "Challenge first. Nobody moves till we know it's ours."

---

## Tone notes

- Relief and discipline. American voices, one word, then the tension drops. Second person present. End of Act 1 = we're a platoon again (or what's left).

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Minefield.
- **After:** Act 2 — Dawn; H-Hour, beach landings in distance; brief the team and move to assault phase.
