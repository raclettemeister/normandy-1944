**Scene ID:** `act2_scene01_dawn`  
**Next default:** `act2_scene02_the_approach`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Rally point or assembly area. H-Hour; beach landings in the distance. Full platoon (or what's left) present.

- **Time:** ~0600. Dawn.
- **Weather:** First light.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Send everyone in one direction with no plan. |
| **Reckless** | Move out without briefing or sectors. |
| **Mediocre** | "Let's go" with no assignment of squads or roles. |
| **Sound** | Brief: sectors, order of march, who's point. Henderson coordinates. |
| **Excellent** | Clear squad/sector assignment; NCOs know their roles; point man and formation. |
| **Masterful** | Full briefing: sectors, point (right man), BAR position, medic location, radio; contingencies. |

---

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Squads/sectors:** Who leads each element (Henderson, Malone, Park). **Personnel hook:** at least 2 decisions with minMen, requiresPhase (platoon), or explicit assignment (who's point).
- **Point man:** Ideal Webb, Jenkins, Washington. Poor: Doyle, Ellis (green), Rivera (medic).
- **BAR:** Kowalski (Novak ammo). **Radio:** Davis at CP or with commander.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Platoon briefed, morale +, time ~15 min. Ready for approach.
- **Partial:** Briefed but rushed or incomplete.
- **Failure:** Confusion, delay; possible morale hit.

---

## Rally soldiers

- All platoon present from Act 1. No new rally.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "We've got the crossroads. I'll take first squad left, Red takes right. Kowalski, you're with me. Doc, stay with the captain."
- **Green fallback:** "Everybody knows their sector. Point man — Webb. Let's move."

---

## Tone notes

- Dawn, distant sounds of battle. Briefing is concrete: names, sectors. Second person present.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** Act 1 — The Rally Point.
- **After:** The Approach — moving toward crossroads through bocage.
