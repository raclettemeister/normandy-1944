# Act 1 Scene 5 — The Sergeant

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene05_sergeant`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene06_patrol`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Stone wall or similar cover. Henderson (platoon sergeant), Malone (NCO), and Doyle (PFC, green) are here. Squad forming.
- **Threats:** Possible distant fire or movement; not yet in contact. Need to consolidate and move.
- **Time:** ~0200.
- **Weather:** Night.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Split the group deliberately or send everyone into the open. |
| **Reckless** | Move without a plan; ignore Henderson's input. |
| **Mediocre** | "Let's go" with no direction or role for anyone. |
| **Sound** | Brief huddle: who's where, what's next. Use Henderson as 2IC. |
| **Excellent** | Clear roles (e.g. Malone on point, Doyle in middle), direction, and next move. |
| **Masterful** | Full coordination: sectors, order of march, and what to do on contact; Henderson acknowledged as 2IC. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Henderson:** 2IC. Ideal for coordinating, not for point. Veteran, steady.
- **Malone:** NCO, brave, hothead. Good for point or assault; not for restraint. **Personnel hook:** putting Malone on point = acceptable; ignoring his aggression can backfire.
- **Doyle:** Green, brave. **Personnel hook:** Doyle on point = risk (green trait); Doyle in middle with Henderson = better. At least 2 decisions should reference minMen, requiresCapability, or role (e.g. "who takes point").
- **Straggler (if present):** Can be given a simple role (follow, carry) — minMen or "one more man" in decisions.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Squad formed, morale +, time ~15 min. Henderson established as 2IC. Possible rally event (Henderson, Malone, Doyle).
- **Partial:** Squad formed but shaky; or time cost.
- **Failure:** Confusion, morale hit, or time lost; no need for casualties yet.

---

## Rally soldiers

- **henderson**, **malone**, **doyle** (this scene is their rally). Reference roster IDs from `src/engine/roster.ts`.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "We're in one piece. Give me a direction and I'll get us there." / "Doyle's green. Keep him off point."
- **Green fallback:** If Henderson is unavailable, use a simpler NCO line (Malone or generic).

---

## Tone notes

- First real squad moment. Names, roles, one or two concrete details (wall, weapon check). Second person present. No melodrama.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Straggler.
- **After:** The Patrol — German patrol at a bridge; first tactical decision with a team.
