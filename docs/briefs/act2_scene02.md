# Act 2 Scene 2 — The Approach

**Scene ID:** `act2_scene02_the_approach`  
**Next default:** `act2_scene03_observation_post`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Bocage; moving toward crossroads. Patrol formation required. Point man ahead.
- **Threats:** Contact possible anywhere. Wrong formation or wrong point man = ambush or delay.
- **Time:** ~0615–0630.
- **Weather:** Dawn, visibility improving.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Column formation in the open; no point. |
| **Reckless** | Move fast without point or interval. |
| **Mediocre** | "Move out" with no formation. |
| **Sound** | Wedge or column with point; interval; NCOs control pace. |
| **Excellent** | Point (right man), bounds, hand signals; BAR in support. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Webb or Jenkins on point (scrounger/sharpshooter); Doyle not on point. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Point:** Ideal Webb, Jenkins, Park (with Webb). Poor Doyle, Ellis, Rivera. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with minMen, requiresCapability (canScout), or "who's point."
- **Formation:** Who covers the flanks; BAR position (Kowalski).

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Safe movement, time ~20 min. Possibly intel (scout finds something).
- **Partial:** Movement with delay or minor contact.
- **Failure:** Ambush, casualties; poor personnel choice (e.g. green on point) can trigger trait.

---

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Webb's got the eyes. He's point. Keep your interval. No bunching."
- **Green fallback:** "Point man stays ahead. Rest of you watch the hedges."

---

## Tone notes

- Movement, tension, hedgerows. Second person present. Names when someone acts.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** Dawn.
- **After:** The Observation Post — hill overlooking objective; recon.
