# Act 1 Scene 1 — The Landing

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene01_landing`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene02_finding_north`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Flooded field (marais). You've just landed; chute tangled, possibly in water or soft ground. Dark. Isolated.
- **Threats:** None immediate. Risk of drowning if gear isn't shed, or of moving blindly without orientation.
- **Time:** ~0100. First minutes after the drop.
- **Weather:** Night, limited visibility, damp.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Deliberately discard gear, ignore orientation, run into open water. |
| **Reckless** | Rush off without checking weapon or harness; no pause to orient. |
| **Mediocre** | Vague "check stuff" or do nothing; no clear sequence. |
| **Sound** | Cut harness, check weapon and basic gear, note landmarks or direction. |
| **Excellent** | Methodical: harness, weapon, compass/visibility, pick a direction before moving. |
| **Masterful** | Same as excellent with clear priority (safety → weapon → orient) and a concrete first step. |

- Short, concrete. Feel the cold, the wet, the silence after the planes. No melodrama. Second person present. "You're in the water. Your chute's dragging."

- **After:** Finding North — player has decided to move and needs a direction.
