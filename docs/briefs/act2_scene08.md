# Act 2 Scene 8 — The Counterfire

**Scene ID:** `act2_scene08_counterfire`  
**Next default:** `act2_scene09_securing`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Crossroads position. Enemy mortar fire incoming. React: move wounded, find cover, discipline.
- **Threats:** Mortar rounds; bunching or panic = more casualties. Need to displace or dig in.
- **Time:** ~0830–0900.
- **Weather:** Morning.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Stand in the open; ignore incoming. |
| **Reckless** | Everyone runs; no order; leave wounded. |
| **Mediocre** | "Take cover" with no plan; chaos. |
| **Sound** | Move wounded to cover; spread out; return fire if targets visible; NCOs hold the line. |
| **Excellent** | Same + displace to defilade; medic to wounded; no bunching. |
| **Masterful** | Same + personnel: Rivera to wounded; Henderson/Malone keep discipline; green (Doyle, Ellis) kept in cover, not panicking. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Wounded:** Rivera (medic) to casualties. **Personnel hook:** 2+ decisions with requiresCapability (canTreatWounded), minMen, or "who moves the wounded."
- **Discipline:** NCOs (Henderson, Malone, Park) hold positions; prevent panic.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Rounds weathered; wounded moved; minimal additional casualties. Time ~20 min. Morale hit possible.
- **Partial:** More casualties; or disorder.
- **Failure:** Significant casualties; possible loss of medic or NCO.

## Rally soldiers

- None. Full platoon.

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Spread out! Doc, get to the wounded. Everybody else — find cover, don't bunch."
- **Green fallback:** "Move the wounded. Spread out. Hold your positions."

---

## Tone notes

- Incoming, impact, dust. Short sentences. Second person present. Death/wounding clinical.

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Cellar.
- **After:** Securing the Position — hold the crossroads; defensive setup.
