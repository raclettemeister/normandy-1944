# Act 1 Scene 6 — The Patrol

**Scene ID:** `act1_scene06_patrol`  
**Next default:** `act1_scene07_farmhouse`

---

## Tactical situation

- **Terrain:** Bridge or crossing. German patrol (small) with possible intel (documents, map).
- **Threats:** Enemy patrol. Can ambush (L-ambush), avoid, or fight in the open. Wrong call = casualties or lost intel.
- **Time:** ~0215–0230.
- **Weather:** Night.

## Tier guidance (suicidal → masterful)

| Tier | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Suicidal** | Charge across the bridge in the open. |
| **Reckless** | Open fire without setup; no kill zone, no withdrawal plan. |
| **Mediocre** | "Attack" with no plan; or freeze and do nothing. |
| **Sound** | L-ambush or flank: set kill zone, BAR/rifles covering, initiate at short range. |
| **Excellent** | Full ambush: who covers, who moves, who grabs intel; clear signals. |
| **Masterful** | Ambush + personnel: right man on BAR (Kowalski not yet here — use Malone/Henderson), Doyle not on the trigger; secure documents after. |

## Personnel assignment opportunities

- **Henderson:** Coordinate; not first through. **Personnel hook:** Henderson coordinating = sound.
- **Malone:** Good for assault or covering fire; hothead — keep him disciplined. **Personnel hook:** Malone on trigger = good; Malone charging early = risk.
- **Doyle:** Green. **Personnel hook:** Doyle on point or trigger = risk (freeze). Doyle in support = better.
- **Straggler:** Can carry or support; minMen for "we need X to set the ambush."
- At least 2 decisions with requiresCapability (e.g. canSuppress once BAR is present), minMen, or explicit role assignment.

---

## State changes (per outcome tier)

- **Success:** Patrol neutralized, intel gained (e.g. hasMap, knowsPatrolRoute), ammo spent, time ~20 min. Readiness may increase (enemy alerted elsewhere).
- **Partial:** Patrol dealt with but intel lost or casualties.
- **Failure:** Casualties, possible loss of initiative; or no intel.

---

## Rally soldiers

- No new rally this scene (Henderson, Malone, Doyle already present). Optional: narrative beat that more troopers are nearby for later rally.

---

## 2IC comments

- **Henderson (veteran):** e.g. "Set the kill zone here. I'll take the left, Red takes the right. Nobody shoots till I say."
- **Green fallback:** Simpler: "We can hit them from here if we're smart about it."

---

## Tone notes

- First real firefight. Short, concrete: muzzle flash, one or two named soldiers. Death clinical if it happens. Second person present.

---

## Scene transition

- **Before:** The Sergeant.
- **After:** The Farmhouse — stone building, 506th gear; Rivera + Kowalski to be found.
