# Objectives and Timeline — 101st Airborne on D-Day

What the 101st Airborne Division was supposed to do on June 6, 1944,
and what actually happened. The gap between plan and reality.

---

## Strategic Context

The 101st Airborne Division's mission was part of the VII Corps plan for Utah Beach.
The amphibious landing would put the 4th Infantry Division ashore on a beach backed
by flooded lowlands. Without the causeways, the seaborne forces would be trapped on
a narrow beach strip with water on three sides. The airborne had to open the exits
before the landing craft hit the sand.

The division's objectives fell into three categories:
1. **Causeway exits** — Open the four roads through the flooded zone
2. **Southern flank** — Block German reinforcements from the south (Carentan direction)
3. **River crossings** — Control or destroy bridges over the Douve to shape the battlefield

---

## The Four Causeways

The causeways were narrow elevated roads running roughly east-west through the flooded
area between Utah Beach and the interior. They were the only passable routes for vehicles
and formed troops.

### Exit 1 — Pouppeville

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Location | Western end at Pouppeville, ~2 km south of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont |
| Road | Local road connecting coast to Pouppeville |
| Assigned to | 1st Battalion, 506th PIR |
| DZ | Drop Zone C |
| Terrain | Causeway ~6 feet above surrounding marsh; drainage ditches 6–8 feet deep |

**The Plan:** 1st Battalion, 506th PIR drops on DZ C, assembles, and moves southeast
to seize the western end of Causeway 1 at Pouppeville before the 4th Infantry Division
arrives from the beach.

### Exit 2 — Houdienville / Sainte-Marie-du-Mont

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Location | Western end near Houdienville, passing through Sainte-Marie-du-Mont |
| Road | Main road from beach to Sainte-Marie-du-Mont |
| Assigned to | 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR |
| DZ | Drop Zone C |
| Terrain | Slightly wider causeway; passes through the village |

**The Plan:** 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR drops on DZ C, assembles, and moves east to
secure Exit 2 and the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. The Brécourt Manor battery
position was adjacent to this causeway, firing on troops and vehicles using Exit 2.

### Exit 3 — Audouville-la-Hubert

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Location | Western end at Audouville-la-Hubert |
| Road | Departmental road from the coast inland |
| Assigned to | 3rd Battalion, 502nd PIR |
| DZ | Drop Zone A |

**The Plan:** 3rd Battalion, 502nd PIR secures the western end of Causeway 3.

### Exit 4 — Saint-Martin-de-Varreville

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Location | Western end at Saint-Martin-de-Varreville |
| Road | Departmental road 423, coast to interior |
| Assigned to | 1st Battalion, 502nd PIR |
| DZ | Drop Zone A |

**The Plan:** 1st Battalion, 502nd PIR secures Exit 4 and eliminates the German coastal
battery at Saint-Martin-de-Varreville (Strongpoint Wn 108).

## Additional Objectives

### Coastal Battery at Saint-Martin-de-Varreville

- **What:** German battery (Strongpoint Wn 108) armed with four 122mm K390/2 guns
  (captured Russian artillery). Commanded by Oberleutnant Erben.
- **Threat:** Could fire on Utah Beach and the approach lanes.
- **Assigned to:** 2nd Battalion, 502nd PIR (LTC Steve A. Chappuis)
- **DZ:** Drop Zone A

### WXYZ Barracks at Mézières

- **What:** German troop billets designated W, X, Y, and Z on Allied maps.
- **Threat:** Garrison that could reinforce causeway defenses.
- **Assigned to:** Elements of the 502nd PIR
- **DZ:** Drop Zone A

### La Barquette Lock

- **What:** Lock on the Canal de Vire et Taute controlling water levels in the
  Douve River plain. At high tide, the marshland around Carentan dropped below sea
  level — the lock held back the tide.
- **Strategic value:** Opening or holding the lock could flood the plain with seawater,
  creating a barrier against German counterattack from the south and east.
- **Assigned to:** 501st PIR (COL Howard R. Johnson)
- **DZ:** Drop Zone D

### Douve River Bridges

- **What:** Highway and railroad bridges over the Douve River northwest of Carentan.
- **Mission:** Destroy to prevent German reinforcement from the south.
- **Assigned to:** 501st PIR and 3rd Battalion, 506th PIR
- **DZ:** Drop Zone D

### Saint-Côme-du-Mont

- **What:** Village at a critical road junction south of the division's operating area.
- **Mission:** Seize or neutralize to block the Carentan–Cherbourg road.
- **Assigned to:** 3rd Battalion, 506th PIR
- **DZ:** Drop Zone D

### Division Command Post — Hiesville

- **What:** Small village selected as the divisional CP location.
- **Mission:** Establish communications and command authority as quickly as possible.
- **Assigned to:** Division HQ elements dropping on DZ C

## Timeline — What Actually Happened

### 0015–0045: Pathfinders Land

Captain Frank Lillyman's pathfinder team hits the ground first. Teams attempt to mark
DZs A, C, and D. Results are uneven — DZ A gets reasonable marking; DZ C and D are
poorly or partially marked. Some pathfinder teams land off-target and cannot reach
their DZs in time.

### 0048–0140: The Main Drop

6,600 paratroopers exit 432 C-47s. Cloud banks and flak have already broken most
formations. The drop is chaotic:

- Sticks intended for DZ C land across a corridor stretching from Ravenoville in the
  north to below Sainte-Marie-du-Mont in the south — a spread of roughly 15 miles.
- Sticks intended for DZ D are scattered even more widely. Some land in the flooded
  Douve valley.
- DZ A drops are the most accurate; the 502nd begins assembling relatively quickly.

Approximately 60% of all equipment bundles and leg bags are lost to water, distance,
or darkness.

### 0130–0300: The Lost Hours

This is the critical gap — between landing and organized action. For 2–4 hours, the
Cotentin Peninsula is full of individual paratroopers and tiny groups trying to figure
out where they are, who is nearby, and what to do.

**MG Maxwell Taylor** lands near Sainte-Marie-du-Mont at ~0130. Spends the next hour
using his cricket and the "Flash/Thunder" challenge to gather men. By 0300, he has
about 85 soldiers — a mix of headquarters staff, signalmen, artillerymen, and infantry
from multiple regiments. He begins moving toward objectives with this improvised force.

**COL Robert Sink** (506th PIR commander) lands and begins assembling elements of his
regiment. Communication between battalions is almost nonexistent — most radios were
lost in the drop.

**COL Howard Johnson** (501st PIR) lands far from DZ D but begins aggressively gathering
men and moving toward La Barquette.

### 0300–0530: First Actions Before Dawn

Small groups begin attacking objectives or engaging German patrols. Actions are
uncoordinated but widespread, adding to German confusion.

**502nd PIR at Saint-Martin-de-Varreville:**
- 2nd Battalion (LTC Chappuis) reaches the coastal battery site.
- The position has already been heavily bombed (RAF strikes on May 28–29 and June 5–6).
- The German garrison has abandoned the battery. The guns are destroyed.
- 1st Battalion (LTC Cassidy) secures the village and approaches Exit 4.
- **Exits 3 and 4 are secured before dawn** — the 502nd accomplishes its primary
  mission relatively quickly because of its accurate drop and the pre-bombardment
  of the battery.

**506th PIR, scattered:**
- 1st Battalion (LTC Turner) is badly scattered. Turner gathers fragments and begins
  moving toward Pouppeville but cannot attack until he has sufficient strength.
- 2nd Battalion (LTC Strayer) is also dispersed. Elements begin gathering near
  Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and Le Grand Chemin.
- 3rd Battalion (LTC Wolverton) is in the worst shape — Wolverton is killed shortly
  after landing. The battalion is leaderless and scattered.

**501st PIR, most scattered:**
- COL Johnson lands far from DZ D. He moves aggressively but can only gather ~150 men
  initially.
- He leads this force toward La Barquette despite being heavily outnumbered.

### 0400: First Glider Echelon

52 Waco CG-4A gliders arrive carrying reinforcements, anti-tank guns, jeeps, and
supplies. Landing is rough — hedgerows, anti-glider obstacles (Rommel's asparagus —
poles planted in open fields), and darkness cause many crash landings.

**BG Don F. Pratt**, Assistant Division Commander, is killed when his glider crashes
during this landing. He is the highest-ranking American officer killed on D-Day.

### 0530–0630: Dawn — Assembly Accelerates

Daylight transforms the situation. Men can see landmarks, read maps, identify terrain
features. Assembly rates increase dramatically. Units that had been stumbling around
in the dark begin to organize.

But the damage from the scattered drop is done — most companies and battalions are still
far below strength. The organized, multi-company attacks envisioned in the plan are
replaced by platoon- and squad-sized actions.

### 0630: H-Hour at Utah Beach

The 4th Infantry Division begins landing at Utah Beach. Due to strong tidal currents,
the landing craft drift approximately 2,000 yards south of the planned beaches —
ironically, this puts them at a less-defended sector.

The seaborne forces need the causeways open. Exits 3 and 4 are already secured.
Exits 1 and 2 are still being fought over.

### 0630–0830: The Causeway Fights

**Exit 1 — Pouppeville:**
- 1st Battalion, 506th PIR has assembled a force and approaches Pouppeville from
  the west and north.
- The village is defended by a German garrison of approximately 60 soldiers from
  the 709th Static Infantry Division.
- A building-by-building fight develops through the village. German positions include
  houses, walled gardens, and roadside positions.
- The fighting takes several hours. By approximately 1100–1200, Pouppeville is cleared.
- Contact is made with elements of the 4th Infantry Division advancing inland from
  the beach. This is the first link-up between airborne and seaborne forces on Utah
  Beach's southern sector.

**Exit 2 — Sainte-Marie-du-Mont:**
- Elements of the 506th PIR (2nd Battalion) and 501st PIR converge on
  Sainte-Marie-du-Mont from multiple directions.
- The village is defended by approximately 60 German artillery troops.
- Fighting centers around the church (which has an excellent observation position in
  its steeple) and the village square.
- The village is largely secured by dawn, but a German column retreating from the coast
  attempts to enter the village later in the morning and is repulsed.
- German artillery strikes the village around midday, damaging the church — the clock
  tower stops at 1330.
- The causeway is opened for traffic by mid-morning, though not fully secured until
  the 4th Infantry Division arrives with Sherman tanks at approximately 1300–1400.

**Brécourt Manor (adjacent to Exit 2):**
- At approximately 0830, LT Richard Winters leads 13 men against a four-gun German
  battery (105mm howitzers) that is firing directly onto Exit 2.
- The battery is destroyed by approximately 1100. (See key-events.md for full account.)

### 0900: Division CP Operational

The 101st Airborne Division command post is established at Hiesville. MG Taylor is
present. Communication with subordinate units is fragmentary — most radio sets were
lost in the drop. Runners and wire are the primary means of communication.

### 0930–1200: Southern Sector Actions

**La Barquette Lock:**
- COL Johnson leads approximately 150 men of the 501st PIR to La Barquette.
- They seize the lock and establish a defensive perimeter.
- German counterattacks throughout the day are repulsed. Johnson's force is isolated
  and outnumbered but holds.
- The lock position is critical — it controls the flooding of the Douve plain.

**Douve River Bridges:**
- Elements of the 501st attempt to reach and destroy the Douve bridges as planned.
- Most units are too scattered and understrength to accomplish this on D-Day.
- Bridge destruction objectives are only partially achieved; some bridges are destroyed,
  others remain intact.

### 1300–1400: Link-Up

The 4th Infantry Division, moving inland from Utah Beach, reaches Sainte-Marie-du-Mont
and Pouppeville. Sherman tanks arrive and the airborne-seaborne link-up is complete in
the northern sector.

The causeways are open. Vehicles, artillery, and reinforcements begin flowing inland.
The immediate crisis is past.

### 2100: Second Glider Echelon

The second wave of gliders arrives, bringing additional troops, artillery, vehicles,
and supplies. Landing conditions are better than the dawn echelon but still rough.

### Midnight, June 6–7: End of D-Day

Division CP at Hiesville has approximately half of the headquarters element accounted for.
The division holds:
- Exits 1, 2, 3, and 4 — all open
- Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and Pouppeville — secured
- Saint-Martin-de-Varreville — secured, battery destroyed
- La Barquette Lock — held but under pressure
- Hiesville — Division CP, operational

The division does **not** fully hold:
- The Douve River bridge objectives — only partially accomplished
- Saint-Côme-du-Mont — not yet taken (would take several more days)
- Full control of the southern flank toward Carentan — contested

## The Gap Between Plan and Reality

### What Worked

1. **All four causeway exits were opened on D-Day.** This was the single most critical
   mission, and it was accomplished — albeit later than planned and at greater cost.

2. **The 502nd PIR's sector was secured quickly.** Thanks to the most accurate drop in
   the division, the 502nd had Exits 3–4 and the coastal battery before dawn.

3. **German confusion was total.** The scattered drop, while unintentional, created the
   impression that paratroopers were everywhere. German command spent hours trying to
   understand the scope of the airborne attack and dispersed their reserves in multiple
   directions.

4. **Individual initiative compensated for organizational chaos.** Officers and NCOs at
   every level gathered whoever they could find and attacked whatever objective was nearest.
   The doctrine of "every man knows the plan" paid off.

### What Didn't Work

1. **Unit integrity was destroyed.** Companies that were supposed to fight as
   companies fought as squads. Battalions that were supposed to coordinate fought as
   isolated platoons. The carefully planned scheme of maneuver was irrelevant.

2. **Timeline slipped badly.** Objectives planned for completion by dawn were still being
   fought for at midday. The 4th Infantry Division had to advance off the beach without
   guaranteed exits for the first hours.

3. **Southern objectives were only partially achieved.** The 501st's Douve River bridge
   missions were delayed and incomplete. The Carentan approach was not fully blocked.
   This would lead to the Battle of Carentan on June 10–14.

4. **Communication was almost nonexistent.** The loss of radios meant that MG Taylor had
   minimal contact with his regiments for most of D-Day. He was commanding a division
   essentially blind, making decisions based on fragmentary reports from runners.

5. **Casualties were heavy.** Approximately 1,500 men were killed, wounded, captured, or
   missing on D-Day alone. This included key leaders — BG Pratt (killed in glider crash),
   LTC Wolverton (killed after landing), LTC Carroll (501st, 1st Battalion — killed),
   and LT Meehan (Easy Company CO — killed when his plane was shot down).

## Casualty Estimates — D-Day

Exact figures for June 6 alone are unreliable. Casualty reporting systems were
overwhelmed and many missing were later found or confirmed over subsequent days.

| Category | Estimate |
|---|---|
| Killed in action | ~200–350 |
| Wounded in action | ~500–600 |
| Missing / captured | ~600–800 |
| Total D-Day casualties | ~1,400–1,500 |
| Equipment lost | ~60% of all bundles and heavy weapons |

The division's total Normandy campaign casualties (June 6 – July 10) were
approximately 4,670: 868 KIA, 2,303 WIA, 665 MIA.

## Key Locations — Reference Grid

For scenario design, these are the primary locations in the 101st's D-Day area:

| Location | Role | Grid Reference (approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| Sainte-Marie-du-Mont | Village objective, Exit 2 | 388-908 |
| Pouppeville | Village objective, Exit 1 | 385-893 |
| Saint-Martin-de-Varreville | Battery site, Exit 4 | 385-935 |
| Audouville-la-Hubert | Exit 3 | 385-922 |
| Hiesville | Division CP | 395-910 |
| Le Grand Chemin | 506th 2nd Bn area, near Brécourt | 390-904 |
| Brécourt Manor | Battery assault site | 391-902 |
| La Barquette | Lock on Canal de Vire et Taute | 378-878 |
| Saint-Côme-du-Mont | Road junction, later objective | 382-885 |
| Angoville-au-Plain | Near DZ D, medical aid station | 387-892 |
| Vierville | Near DZ D | 388-888 |
| Culoville | 506th assembly area | 393-915 |

Grid references are approximate, based on the 1:50,000 military grid system used
in 1944 planning maps. Use for relative positioning, not precision.
