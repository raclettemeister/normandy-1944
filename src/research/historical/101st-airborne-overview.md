## The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment

### Formation and Character

The 506th PIR was an unusual regiment. It was formed on July 20, 1942, at Camp Toccoa,
Georgia, as a "test-tube" unit — an experiment in training paratroopers from scratch at a
single location rather than sending recruits through the standard Fort Benning jump school
pipeline.

Colonel Robert F. Sink commanded the regiment from activation through the end of the war.
Sink was a career officer, tough and demanding, who shaped the regiment's identity from
the beginning. He remained a constant — the one senior leader the men knew for the
entire war.

### Recruitment and Selection

Of approximately 5,800 volunteers who arrived at Toccoa, only 1,948 completed training
to fill the regiment. The selection was brutal and deliberate: anyone who couldn't keep up
physically or mentally was removed. The men who survived were overwhelmingly young (18–25),
fit, and motivated.

Initial cadre NCOs were experienced "Old Army" men brought in to train the recruits. As
training progressed, these NCOs were replaced by soldiers promoted from within the
regiment's own ranks — creating a unit led entirely by men who had come through the
same pipeline.

### Camp Toccoa (July – November 1942)

Camp Toccoa was a remote, purpose-built training facility 5 miles outside Toccoa, Georgia,
constructed under the WPA in the 1930s. The regiment trained there for 13 weeks.

**Currahee Mountain** was the regiment's defining feature — a 1,740-foot peak (Cherokee
for "We Stand Alone") overlooking the camp. The standard physical test was running Currahee:
3 miles up, 3 miles down. This became the regiment's motto and identity marker.

Training was all-encompassing:
- Physical conditioning: calisthenics, obstacle courses, forced marches, runs up Currahee
- Weapons: M1 Garand, M1 Carbine, Thompson SMG, M1919 .30-cal MG, 60mm mortar, bazooka
- Tactics: squad and platoon maneuvers, night operations, demolitions
- Hand-to-hand combat

No parachute training occurred at Toccoa — that came later. The emphasis was on creating
infantry soldiers first.

### The March to Atlanta (November 1942)

In late November 1942, the entire regiment marched 118 miles from Camp Toccoa to Atlanta,
Georgia, in approximately 75 hours — a forced march designed to demonstrate the
regiment's fitness and generate publicity. From Atlanta, they traveled by train to Fort
Benning for jump school.

### Fort Benning Jump School (December 1942)

Standard Army parachute training: 5 qualifying jumps over several weeks. The regiment
completed jump school by Christmas Day 1942, earning their jump wings.

### Stateside Deployments (1943)

After jump school, the regiment moved through several stateside posts:
- Fort Bragg, North Carolina
- Camp Mackall, North Carolina (large-scale maneuvers and exercises)

On June 10, 1943, the 506th PIR was officially attached to the 101st Airborne Division.

### Aldbourne, England (September 1943 – June 1944)

The regiment sailed to England aboard the troop ship SS Samaria, arriving September 15,
1943, and was billeted in the village of **Aldbourne, Wiltshire**.

**Billeting:** Officers were housed in the old Rectory and private homes. Enlisted men
occupied Nissen huts on Farm Lane and overflow housing in local buildings. Regimental
headquarters was at **Littlecote House**, a Tudor manor nearby.

**Village life:** Aldbourne was a small English village with about 1,000 residents. The
troops used five pubs — The Blue Boar was the officers' pub; The Crown served all ranks.
Relations with locals were generally positive despite the massive influx.

**Training in England:**
- Field exercises across Wiltshire and surrounding counties
- Night operations, close combat, demolitions, mine warfare
- Chemical warfare familiarization
- Division-level exercises (Exercise Eagle, Exercise Tiger)
- Intensive physical training continued

**Marshalling:** In late May 1944, the regiment moved to **Uppottery Airfield** in Devon —
the marshalling area and departure airfield for Operation Overlord. Here the men were
briefed on their specific D-Day missions using sand tables and aerial photographs, sealed
behind barbed wire to maintain operational security.

## Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR

### Organization

Easy Company was a standard rifle company in the 506th PIR:

- **Headquarters section:** Company commander, executive officer, first sergeant, clerks, runners
- **1st Platoon**
- **2nd Platoon**
- **3rd Platoon**

Each platoon comprised:
- 3 rifle squads (12 men each)
- 1 mortar squad (60mm mortar, 6 men)

Each rifle squad carried one .30-caliber M1919 light machine gun.

**Total company strength:** ~140 men (132 enlisted, 8 officers) at full strength.

### Weapons (per company)

- M1 Garand rifles (primary individual weapon)
- M1 Carbines (officers, NCOs, support troops)
- Thompson M1A1 submachine guns (squad leaders, officers)
- Colt M1911A1 pistols (sidearms)
- M1919A4 .30-caliber light machine guns (one per squad)
- 60mm M2 mortars (one per platoon)
- Bazookas (M1A1 rocket launcher)
- Fragmentation grenades, smoke grenades
- Gammon grenades (for anti-armor/demolition)
- TNT blocks, detonators

### Key Personnel (as of June 6, 1944)

| Role | Name | Rank |
|---|---|---|
| Company Commander | Thomas Meehan III | 1LT (KIA June 6 — plane shot down) |
| Executive Officer / Acting CO | Richard D. Winters | 1LT |
| 1st Platoon Leader | — | — |
| 2nd Platoon Leader | Lynn D. "Buck" Compton | 2LT |
| 3rd Platoon Leader | — | — |
| First Sergeant | William S. Evans | 1SG |

After Meehan's C-47 was shot down over Normandy (no survivors), Winters assumed
command of Easy Company and led it through D-Day and beyond.

### Notable Enlisted (D-Day)

- SGT William "Wild Bill" Guarnere — squad leader, aggressive fighter
- SGT Carwood Lipton — platoon sergeant, respected by all ranks
- SGT Donald Malarkey — rifleman, machine gunner
- CPL Joseph Toye — rifleman
- PVT Robert "Popeye" Wynn — rifleman
- T/5 Joseph Liebgott — scout, interpreter (spoke German)

### D-Day Jump Strength

Easy Company jumped with approximately 140 men on the night of June 5–6.
By dawn on June 6, only about **9 riflemen, 2 officers** (Winters and one other),
**2 light machine guns, 1 bazooka, and 1 mortar** had assembled — roughly 10% of
the company's strength.

This was typical of what happened across the division. Companies that were supposed
to fight as organized units instead spent hours — sometimes the entire day — gathering
scattered men and improvising.

## German Opposition

The 101st dropped into an area defended by several German units:

### Primary Threats

- **91st Luftlande (Air-Landing) Division** — Arrived in the Cotentin Peninsula in May
  1944. ~7,500 men. Commander: Generalmajor Wilhelm Falley (killed June 6 in an ambush
  by American paratroopers). Included Grenadier-Regiment 1057 and 1058.

- **6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment** — Attached to the 91st Division. An elite German
  paratrooper unit under Major Friedrich-August Freiherr von der Heydte. Three battalions.
  These were the most capable German troops in the area.

### Secondary Forces

- **709th Static Infantry Division** — Defended the eastern Cotentin coast including
  Utah Beach. A low-quality unit with three battalions partly manned by former Soviet
  POWs and Polish conscripts. German officers considered them unreliable.

- **243rd Static Infantry Division** — Held the western coast. Similar quality to the 709th.

- **Various coastal defense batteries and Ost-Bataillone (Eastern Battalions)** composed
  of non-German personnel.

### Antiaircraft Defenses

German flak positions were heavy throughout the Cotentin Peninsula and along the
approach corridors. Antiaircraft fire was the single greatest factor in disrupting
the airborne drop, scattering C-47 formations and causing pilots to deviate from
planned flight paths.

- Stephen Ambrose's research on the 506th PIR
- Division operational records

Where sources conflict on specific details (dates, exact strengths, precise times),
the most commonly cited figure is used. Some battalion-level command assignments
may have changed between the marshalling period and the actual jump.
