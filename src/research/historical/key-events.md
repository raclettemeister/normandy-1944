## 1. The Brécourt Manor Assault

### The Textbook Attack on a Fixed Position

**Time:** ~0830–1100, June 6, 1944
**Location:** Brécourt Manor, near Le Grand Chemin, ~3 miles southwest of Utah Beach
**Unit:** Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th PIR (ad-hoc force)
**Leader:** 1LT Richard D. Winters
**Award:** Distinguished Service Cross (Winters)

This action is still taught at West Point as a model for assaulting a fixed position
with inferior numbers.

### Situation

Four German 105mm howitzers from No. 6 Battery, 90th Artillery Regiment, were
emplaced in a hedgerow-bordered field between Le Grand Chemin and Brécourt Manor.
The guns were firing on Exit 2 from Utah Beach — shelling the causeway where the
4th Infantry Division was unloading men and vehicles.

The battery was connected by a trench system running along the hedgerow line. Each
gun sat in a prepared position along the trench, with ammunition stored in side
chambers. The trenches provided cover, communication between gun positions, and
easy resupply — but also created a linear vulnerability that Winters would exploit.

A German phone line ran from the battery to an observation post on Utah Beach,
directing fire. Machine gun positions covered the approaches. The battery was
defended by an estimated platoon-strength force (~50 soldiers).

The American CP was only 530 yards from the battery position. The guns had to be
silenced.

### The Force

Winters assembled **13 men** from Easy Company and other units. This was not a
company-level attack as planned — it was what he could scrape together from the
scattered drop. His force included:

**Easy Company personnel:**
- 1LT Richard D. Winters (assault leader)
- 2LT Lynn D. "Buck" Compton
- SGT William "Wild Bill" Guarnere
- SGT Carwood Lipton
- PVT Donald Malarkey
- CPL Joseph Toye
- Additional E Company men (exact roster varies by source)

**Supporting force (arrived later):**
- 2LT Ronald C. Speirs, Dog Company — led the assault on the 4th gun
- Additional men from Dog and Fox Companies

**Weapons available:**
- M1 Garand rifles
- 2x M1919A4 .30-cal light machine guns (for base of fire)
- Thompson submachine guns
- Fragmentation and smoke grenades
- 1x bazooka
- TNT blocks (for destroying guns)
- German stick grenades (captured during the assault)

### The Assault — Sequence

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Setup**

Winters crawled forward to observe the position. He identified the trench system
connecting the four guns and recognized that the trenches were both the German
strength (covered movement, resupply) and their weakness (a covered approach for
attackers who could get into the trench).

He positioned the two machine guns to provide suppressive fire across the open field
side of the battery position.

**Phase 2: Flanking Attack on Gun 1**

Compton, Malarkey, and Guarnere moved to a flanking position. They attacked a German
machine gun covering the approach, using grenades to destroy it, then provided covering
fire for the main assault group.

Winters led the rest of his force along the hedgerow and into the trench system.

**Phase 3: Gun 1 Destroyed**

Winters and his men entered the trench and fought their way to the first gun position.
Close-quarters fighting in the trench — grenades, rifles at point-blank range. The
first gun crew was killed or driven off.

Destruction method: a block of TNT was placed down the barrel of the howitzer and
detonated using a German potato-masher stick grenade as a fuse. This split the barrel
and rendered the gun permanently inoperable.

**Phase 4: Guns 2 and 3**

Using the same trench system the Germans had built to connect their positions, Winters'
team moved from gun to gun. Each position was assaulted in turn — grenades first, then
riflemen rushing the position. Each gun was destroyed with TNT down the barrel.

Between guns, the team encountered German soldiers moving through the trench to
reinforce. These engagements were at very close range — sometimes 10–15 feet in the
narrow trench.

**Phase 5: Gun 4 — Speirs' Assault**

By the time the team reached the fourth gun, they were low on ammunition and
exhausted. Reinforcements from Dog Company arrived, led by 2LT Ronald Speirs.

Speirs was known as an extremely aggressive officer. Rather than use the trench
approach, he led his men in a direct assault over open ground, exposing himself to
German fire. The fourth gun was taken and destroyed.

**Phase 6: Withdrawal Under Fire**

After all four guns were disabled, the force came under heavy machine gun fire from
Brécourt Manor itself (the fortified farmhouse overlooking the battery position).
Winters ordered withdrawal.

### Intelligence Windfall

In one of the gun positions, Winters discovered a **German tactical map** showing the
locations of all German artillery positions and machine gun nests in the Utah Beach
sector of the Cotentin Peninsula.

Winters gave the map to Captain Lewis Nixon, the 2nd Battalion intelligence officer.
Nixon passed it up the chain. Division and corps intelligence considered this find so
valuable that they dispatched the **first two Sherman tanks** to reach Utah Beach to
support Winters' paratroopers. Winters directed their fire against remaining German
resistance around Brécourt.

### Casualties and Results

| Side | Killed | Wounded |
|---|---|---|
| American | 4 | 6 |
| German | ~15–20 killed | ~12 captured |

- 4 x 105mm howitzers destroyed
- 1 x machine gun position destroyed
- German map of all defenses in the sector captured
- Exit 2 shelling stopped — 4th Infantry Division unloading resumed

### Why This Matters for Game Design

The Brécourt Manor assault demonstrates several key principles:

1. **Fire and maneuver at the squad level.** Winters used a base of fire (machine guns)
   to suppress while a maneuver element attacked from the flank. Textbook, but executed
   under fire with 13 men against ~50.

2. **Trench fighting.** The assault moved through a connected trench system, clearing
   positions sequentially. This is a fundamentally different experience than open-field
   combat — claustrophobic, close-range, dependent on grenades.

3. **Initiative.** Winters was ordered to take the battery but was given no specific plan.
   He reconnoitered, assessed, and designed the attack himself on the spot.

4. **Ad-hoc forces.** The attack was carried out by a scratch team, not an organized
   platoon. Men from different squads and companies had to work together under a leader
   most of them didn't know well.

## 2. The Battle of Pouppeville

### Clearing Exit 1

**Time:** ~0600–1200, June 6, 1944
**Location:** Pouppeville, western end of Causeway Exit 1
**Unit:** 1st Battalion, 506th PIR (elements)
**Leader:** LTC William L. Turner (battalion); various company-level officers

### Situation

Pouppeville was a small Norman village at the western end of Causeway 1, the
southernmost route off Utah Beach. The causeway was a narrow elevated road running
east-west through flooded marshland — approximately 6 feet above the water level,
with drainage ditches 6–8 feet deep on either sides.

The village was defended by approximately 60 German soldiers from the 709th Static
Infantry Division. These were not elite troops — the 709th included Ost-Bataillone
(Eastern Battalion) soldiers, former Soviet POWs pressed into German service, and
older German reservists. But they were in prepared defensive positions in stone
buildings with good fields of fire down the main road.

### The Approach

1st Battalion, 506th PIR was badly scattered in the drop. LTC Turner assembled
elements through the night, but by dawn he had only a fraction of his battalion
strength — estimates range from 50 to 100 men, drawn from multiple companies.

The approach to Pouppeville was from the northwest and west, across hedgerow-enclosed
fields. The battalion moved cautiously — every hedgerow could conceal a German
position, and every field had to be crossed in the open before reaching the cover
of the next hedge.

### The Fight

The battle for Pouppeville was a building-by-building clearance:

- American paratroopers entered the village from the western edge
- German positions in stone farmhouses and behind garden walls had to be reduced
  individually
- Rifle fire, grenades tossed through windows, and room-by-room clearance
- German resistance was stubborn but uncoordinated — the defenders had no reserves
  and no reinforcement route
- Snipers in upper-story windows slowed the American advance
- The Americans used fire teams: one element suppressed the building while another
  maneuvered to a flanking position or entry point

The fighting took approximately 4–6 hours. By late morning (~1100–1200), the village
was cleared.

### Link-Up

Shortly after Pouppeville was secured, elements of the 4th Infantry Division,
advancing inland from Utah Beach along Causeway 1, reached the village. This was one
of the first link-ups between airborne and seaborne forces on D-Day.

The moment was significant — it confirmed that the causeways were open and that
vehicles and reinforcements could begin flowing inland.

### Why This Matters for Game Design

1. **Village clearance.** Stone buildings, narrow streets, garden walls, limited
   visibility. Fundamentally different from open-field combat.

2. **Low-quality defenders can still fight.** The 709th's Ost-Bataillone were not
   first-line troops, but in prepared positions they were effective enough to delay
   an airborne battalion for hours.

3. **The causeway as terrain feature.** A single elevated road through flooded marsh
   creates a natural chokepoint. Controlling the western end means controlling the exit.

4. **Linkup operations.** Two friendly forces approaching each other from opposite
   directions, neither sure of the other's exact position. Fratricide risk was real.

## 3. The Fighting at Sainte-Marie-du-Mont

### Securing Exit 2 and the Village

**Time:** ~0300–1400, June 6, 1944
**Location:** Sainte-Marie-du-Mont
**Units:** Elements of 506th PIR (2nd Battalion), 501st PIR
**Key feature:** Church with stone steeple (observation post)

### Situation

Sainte-Marie-du-Mont was a Norman village of stone buildings clustered around a
medieval church. It sat at the western end of Causeway Exit 2 and was a junction
point for several local roads. Controlling it meant controlling both the causeway
and road access to the surrounding area.

The village was garrisoned by approximately 60 German artillery troops. These men
were part of a battery organization — not front-line infantry, but armed and in
defensive positions.

### The Night Fight

Paratroopers from the 506th and 501st PIRs began landing in and around
Sainte-Marie-du-Mont from ~0100 onward. Some men landed directly in the village.
Firefights broke out immediately — confused, close-range encounters in streets and
gardens in total darkness.

The church steeple was immediately recognized as the dominant terrain feature. It
offered observation over the entire village and the surrounding countryside. Both
sides understood its value:

- German soldiers initially held positions in and around the church
- American paratroopers fought to seize the church and establish an observation post
  in the steeple
- The village square changed hands in the predawn hours as small groups from both
  sides attacked and counterattacked

### Dawn and Consolidation

By dawn (~0530), American paratroopers held most of the village. The church steeple
was in American hands, providing observation over the approaches.

Later in the morning, a **German column retreating from the coast** attempted to
enter Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. American paratroopers, now organized and in defensive
positions, repulsed the column with rifle, machine gun, and mortar fire. The Germans
fell back.

### Artillery Strike

Around midday, approximately a dozen German artillery shells struck the village,
damaging several buildings and hitting the church. The clock in the bell tower was
stopped at **1330** (1:30 PM) — it has never been repaired and stands today as a
memorial.

American paratroopers in the steeple survived the shelling.

### 4th Infantry Division Arrives

At approximately 1300–1400, elements of the 4th Infantry Division arrived from the
east with Sherman tanks. The village was now firmly held, and the Exit 2 causeway
was fully open.

### Why This Matters for Game Design

1. **Night fighting in a village.** Close-range combat in streets and buildings in
   total darkness. Identification of friend and foe is nearly impossible.

2. **The church as a key terrain feature.** A tall stone building in the center of the
   village provides observation and fields of fire. Taking and holding it changes the
   tactical situation.

3. **Counterattack.** A retreating German column attempts to pass through the village —
   a hasty defense against an unexpected direction of attack.

4. **Combined arms.** The arrival of tanks transforms a tenuous airborne defense into
   a secure position.

## 4. Colonel Johnson at La Barquette

### Holding the Lock with 150 Men

**Time:** ~0430–end of D-Day, June 6, 1944
**Location:** La Barquette Lock, Canal de Vire et Taute
**Unit:** 501st PIR (elements), ~150 men
**Leader:** COL Howard R. "Jumpy" Johnson

### Situation

The La Barquette lock controlled the water level in the Douve River plain south of
the 101st's operating area. At high tide, the low marshland around Carentan dropped
below sea level — the lock held back tidal seawater. If opened or controlled, the
resulting flooding would create a water barrier protecting the American southern flank.

Johnson's orders were to seize the lock and hold it. The full 501st PIR (~2,000 men)
was supposed to accomplish this. But the scattered drop left Johnson with approximately
**150 men** — less than 10% of his regiment.

### The Action

Johnson landed far from DZ D. He was aggressive by nature (his nickname "Jumpy" was
ironic — he was anything but hesitant) and immediately began gathering men and
moving toward his objective.

He reached La Barquette with his ~150-man force in the predawn hours. The lock was
seized against light initial resistance. But Johnson's force was now isolated —
south of the main division area, with the flooded Douve plain between him and
friendly forces, and German troops on three sides.

German counterattacks came throughout the day:
- Infantry probes from the south and east
- Mortar and artillery fire on the lock position
- At least one organized counterattack by elements of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment

Johnson's men held. They had rifles, a few machine guns, limited ammunition, and no
artillery support (the 377th Parachute Field Artillery had lost most of its guns in
the drop). They held by fire discipline, field fortification, and sheer stubbornness.

The lock remained in American hands through D-Day and beyond.

### Why This Matters for Game Design

1. **Isolated defense.** A small force holding a critical position with no
   reinforcement, no resupply, and no communication with higher headquarters.

2. **Terrain as weapon.** The lock itself is the objective — not just a piece of ground
   but a mechanism that controls the battlefield. Flooding the Douve plain denies
   the Germans an approach route.

3. **Leadership under pressure.** Johnson had 7.5% of his planned force. He attacked
   anyway. His aggression and willingness to act with what he had exemplifies the
   airborne mindset on D-Day.

4. **6th Fallschirmjäger opposition.** German paratroopers vs. American paratroopers.
   The most capable German troops in the sector attacking the most outnumbered
   American position.

## 5. The Death of General Pratt

### Glider Crash at LZ E

**Time:** ~0400, June 6, 1944
**Location:** Near Hiesville, Landing Zone E
**Casualty:** BG Don F. Pratt, Assistant Division Commander, 101st Airborne

BG Pratt was the highest-ranking American officer killed on D-Day. He arrived in the
first glider echelon at approximately 0400. His Waco CG-4A glider, heavily loaded,
struck a hedgerow on landing. Pratt was killed in the crash.

The glider landing was inherently dangerous — the LZs were small fields surrounded by
hedgerows and obstructed by Rommel's "asparagus" (wooden poles driven into open fields
to tear apart gliders). Night landings compounded the danger. Many gliders crashed,
some catastrophically. Pratt's death was not unusual in mechanism — it was notable
because of his rank.

BG Anthony McAuliffe, the division artillery commander, assumed Pratt's role as
Assistant Division Commander in addition to his own duties.

## 6. The Killing of Generalmajor Falley

### German Division Commander Ambushed

**Time:** ~0130–0200, June 6, 1944
**Location:** Near Picauville, west of Sainte-Mère-Église
**Casualty:** Generalmajor Wilhelm Falley, Commander, 91st Luftlande Division

Falley was returning by car from a war game exercise in Rennes when the airborne
drops began. His vehicle was ambushed by American paratroopers (likely from the
82nd Airborne, though accounts vary) near Picauville. Falley was killed.

His death decapitated the 91st Luftlande Division at the moment it needed leadership
most. The 91st was the primary German formation in the airborne landing area, and
losing its commanding general in the opening hours of the invasion contributed to
the disorganized German response.

---

## 7. The Medics at Angoville-au-Plain

### Aid Station in No-Man's Land

**Time:** June 6 onward
**Location:** Church at Angoville-au-Plain
**Personnel:** PFC Robert Wright and PFC Kenneth Moore, 501st PIR medics

Two medics from the 501st PIR set up an aid station in the church at
Angoville-au-Plain, a small village near DZ D. The village changed hands between
American and German forces multiple times on D-Day.

Wright and Moore treated wounded from both sides — American paratroopers and German
soldiers — throughout the fighting. When the village was in German hands, the medics
continued treating the wounded. When it was in American hands, they did the same.

The church floor is still stained with blood from D-Day. The pews where wounded were
laid still bear the marks.

### Why This Matters for Game Design

Medical care on D-Day was primitive and improvised. Most medical supplies were lost
in the drop. Aid stations were wherever a medic could find a building with a roof.
The convention of treating wounded from both sides — while fighting raged outside —
adds moral complexity to the combat narrative.

---

## 8. Small Unit Combat — Common Patterns

These patterns recurred throughout D-Day and should inform scenario design:

### The Hedgerow Ambush

A German squad in a hedgerow opens fire on American paratroopers crossing an open
field. The Americans hit the dirt, return fire at muzzle flashes they can barely see,
and attempt to maneuver to a flanking position through an adjacent hedgerow. The
engagement lasts 5–15 minutes and is decided by whoever gets a flanking position first
or whoever runs out of ammunition.

### The Road Encounter

A small group of paratroopers moving along a sunken lane (a road cut between two
hedgerows) encounters a German patrol coming the other way. The engagement is at
close range — 20–50 yards — and is over in seconds. Whoever fires first usually wins.

### The Farm Clearing

A fortified farmhouse occupied by a German squad. Stone walls, small windows, limited
approaches. American paratroopers must assault using fire and movement — suppress the
windows, get close, throw grenades, and enter. Casualties are almost guaranteed.

### The Bridge/Causeway Firefight

A narrow elevated road or bridge with open, flooded ground on either side. Neither
side can maneuver — it's a frontal firefight, decided by volume of fire, cover, and
eventually reinforcement from one side or the other.

### The Night Encounter

Two men meet in a hedgerow in the dark. One clicks a cricket. The other may or may not
respond correctly. The decision to fire or not fire must be made in a fraction of a
second based on sound, silhouette, and instinct. Fratricide was a real and persistent
danger throughout D-Day night.

## Summary — Combat Character of D-Day for the 101st

| Factor | Reality |
|---|---|
| Typical unit size | 5–30 men, mixed from multiple companies |
| Communication | Almost none between units; voice and runners only |
| Visibility | Near-zero at night; 50–200m in bocage by day |
| Engagement range | 25–150m typical; often much closer |
| Ammunition | Limited; resupply uncertain |
| Heavy weapons | Mostly lost; rifles and grenades were the primary weapons |
| Medical support | Improvised; most medical supplies lost in drop |
| Leadership | Lowest-ranking officer or NCO present took command |
| Enemy quality | Variable — 709th Static (poor) to 6th FJR (excellent) |
| Terrain | Hedgerows, flooded fields, stone villages, narrow roads |
| Duration | Engagements were short (5–30 min); the operational day was endless |

The defining character of D-Day combat for the 101st Airborne was **improvisation
under extreme uncertainty**. Nothing went according to plan. The men who succeeded
were those who could assess a situation, make a decision, and act — with whatever
resources and personnel were at hand.
