## Parachute and Jump Gear

### T-5 Parachute Assembly

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Main chute | T-5, back-mounted, static-line deployed |
| Reserve chute | Chest-mounted, manual pull |
| Total weight | ~27 lbs (main + reserve) |
| Canopy diameter | 28 feet |
| Descent rate | ~16 fps (roughly 11 mph) |

Static-line deployment meant the chute opened automatically when the trooper exited the aircraft — no freefall. At jump altitude of 600–1,000 feet, the trooper was under canopy for roughly 30–60 seconds. During that time he was a target for ground fire with zero ability to evade.

After landing, the parachute had to be collapsed and shed quickly. Paratroopers carried an M2 switchblade in a collar pocket specifically for cutting tangled risers or lines if snagged in trees.

### Leg Bags (Griswold Containers)

Leg bags strapped below the reserve chute and dangled on a 20-foot rope during descent. They carried heavy equipment: ammunition, radios, crew-served weapon components, mortar rounds, explosives.

**The D-Day disaster:** Leg bags were catastrophically unreliable. The opening shock of the parachute, combined with turbulence and high-speed exits, ripped the bags free. Estimates suggest **60–70% of leg bags were lost** on D-Day night. This meant:

- Machine gun teams landed without their guns
- Mortar crews had tubes but no baseplates or rounds
- Bazooka teams lost rockets
- Radiomen lost radios
- Demolition teams lost explosives

This single equipment failure shaped the entire first 24 hours of airborne combat. Units fought with whatever they had on their bodies.

## Recognition and Identification

### Cricket Clicker

A small brass toy noisemaker, manufactured by ACME Whistles (Birmingham). 7,000 produced for the 101st Airborne.

**How it worked:** One click asked "Who's there?" Two clicks in response meant "Friend." Simple, distinctive, audible at short range without being as loud as a voice challenge.

Issued roughly 4 days before D-Day. Designed by Brigadier General Maxwell Taylor after disastrous friendly-fire incidents during the Sicily jumps, where scattered paratroopers couldn't identify each other in the dark.

**Limitation:** Only effective for the first 24 hours. After that, the risk of Germans capturing crickets and using them as lures meant they were abandoned in favor of verbal challenge-and-response passwords ("Flash" / "Thunder" on D-Day).

**Game relevance:** The cricket mechanic works for the opening night missions. After dawn, it becomes obsolete. Players hearing a cricket must decide: trust it, or assume it's a trap?

### Luminous Disks and Flag Armbands

Small glow-in-the-dark disks were sewn onto helmet backs or shoulders for short-range visual identification at night. American flag armbands (48-star) were worn on the right shoulder to prevent friendly fire from Allied troops who might encounter paratroopers behind lines.

## Navigation Equipment

### Wrist Compass

Small luminescent-dial compass worn on the wrist or attached to web gear. Essential for night navigation after the drop, when landmarks were invisible and paratroopers were often miles from their intended drop zones.

### Maps

Silk or rayon escape maps — lightweight, waterproof, silent when handled. Showed Normandy with grid references. Some were printed on scarves that could be worn or used as bandages in emergencies.

Standard paper tactical maps were also issued to officers and NCOs with pre-marked objectives, rally points, and phase lines.

### Flashlight with Red Lens

Standard US Army angle-head flashlight (TL-122) with a red filter. Red light preserves night vision and is less visible at distance. Used for map reading, signaling, and movement in darkness.

## Field Equipment

### Entrenching Tool (M-1943)

Folding shovel, ~2.5 lbs. Folds to fit on the web belt.

In Normandy's hedgerow country, digging in was survival. The earthen embankments of bocage provided natural cover, but paratroopers needed to improve positions, dig foxholes, and create firing positions. The entrenching tool was also used as a close-combat weapon in desperate situations.

### Canteen and Cup

Standard 1-quart canteen in canvas cover with nesting cup. Water discipline was critical — paratroopers had no resupply on D-Day and fought in June heat. One quart was insufficient for sustained combat operations.

### K-Rations

Three meals per day in small, waterproof boxes. Each meal: ~800 calories. Breakfast, Dinner, Supper variants. Contents included compressed biscuits, canned meat/cheese, instant coffee, sugar, cigarettes, gum, and toilet paper.

Paratroopers typically jumped with 2–3 days of K-rations. Compact but not enough for sustained operations without resupply.

### M1923 Cartridge Belt / M1936 Pistol Belt

10-pocket belt carrying 80 rounds of .30-06 in clips (for Garand) or loose rounds. The web gear system (belt + M1943 suspenders) distributed load across shoulders and hips. Additional ammunition carried in bandoliers draped over shoulders.

### M1928 Haversack / Musette Bag

The haversack carried personal gear, extra rations, socks, poncho. The musette bag was a smaller general-purpose bag. Paratroopers often carried both, crammed with everything they could fit.

## Communication

### SCR-300 Radio ("Walkie-Talkie")

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Type | FM transceiver, backpack-mounted |
| Weight | 35–40 lbs (with batteries) |
| Frequency | 40.0–48.0 MHz |
| Range | ~3 miles cross-country; up to 5 miles favorable terrain |
| Battery life | ~20 hours continuous use |
| Crew | 1 radioman (dedicated carrier) |

The SCR-300 was the battalion and company-level radio — critical for coordinating between scattered units. Nearly 50,000 produced by Motorola during the war.

**D-Day problem:** Many radios were lost in leg bags or damaged on impact. Units that lost their SCR-300 had no way to coordinate beyond runner or voice contact. This is why D-Day devolved into small-unit actions — without radios, company and battalion commanders couldn't control their spread-out forces.

**Game relevance:** The radio is a strategic asset, not just equipment. A squad with radio contact to higher HQ can call for fire support, report enemy positions, and coordinate with adjacent units. A squad without a radio is on its own. Protecting the radioman matters.

### SCR-536 "Handie-Talkie"

Smaller, handheld AM radio for platoon-level communication. Range ~1 mile. Less reliable than the SCR-300 but much lighter (~5 lbs). Issued to platoon leaders for short-range coordination.

## Grenades and Explosives

### Mk 2 Fragmentation Grenade ("Pineapple")

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Weight | 1.3 lbs (0.6 kg) |
| Fuse delay | 4–5 seconds |
| Lethal radius | ~5 yards |
| Casualty radius | ~15 yards |
| Effective throwing range | 30–40 yards |

The standard US fragmentation grenade. Cast iron body with serrated surface — the grooves aided grip more than fragmentation pattern. The M10A3 fuse gave 4–5 seconds of delay.

Paratroopers typically carried 2–4 fragmentation grenades. Essential for clearing positions, hedgerow corners, and buildings where direct fire couldn't reach.

### Smoke Grenades (M8 and M18)

White or colored smoke, ~30-second burn time. Used for:
- Screening movement across open ground
- Marking positions for aircraft or adjacent units
- Signaling — different colors had pre-assigned meanings

Smoke is critical in hedgerow fighting where short dashes across open gaps between bocage are lethal without concealment.

### Gammon Bomb (No. 82 Grenade)

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Weight | Variable (1–2 lbs of explosive) |
| Fuse | No. 247 percussion impact |
| Explosive | C-2 plastic explosive or Nobel 808 |
| Detonation | On impact (no delay) |

A British-designed weapon adopted enthusiastically by American airborne. A cloth stockinette bag with a screw-on always-fuze cap. The paratrooper filled it with whatever amount of plastic explosive the mission demanded.

**Why paratroopers loved it:** Infinitely adaptable. Half a pound of C-2 against a vehicle tire. Two pounds against a bunker wall. It detonated on impact — no fuse delay, no dud risk from soft ground. Against light vehicles, it was devastating. Against tanks, a well-placed Gammon bomb on the engine deck could disable or destroy.

**Game relevance:** The Gammon bomb is the paratrooper's improvised anti-armor tool. When bazookas are lost in the drop, Gammon bombs are often the only anti-vehicle weapon available. Short range (throwing distance), high risk, high reward.

## Medical Supplies

### First Aid Packet

Every paratrooper carried a basic first aid packet containing:
- **Sulfa powder** — poured directly into wounds to prevent infection
- **Carlisle bandage** — large sterile field dressing
- **Morphine syrettes** — small tubes of morphine for self-injection pain management. Medics carried multiple; individual soldiers carried 1–2

Medics additionally carried:
- Plasma units (for treating shock and blood loss)
- Additional bandages and tourniquets
- Surgical instruments for emergency procedures
- More morphine syrettes

**The medic's role:** Airborne medics were unarmed by Geneva Convention and marked with red cross brassards. They moved between casualties under fire. Losing the platoon medic meant wounded men bled out or suffered shock without treatment. In-game, the medic is a high-value non-combatant.

## What Paratroopers Typically Lost in the Drop

The D-Day night drop was chaotic. Planes scattered by anti-aircraft fire dropped men miles from their DZs. Equipment was lost in three ways:

### 1. Leg Bag Failures
60–70% of leg bags tore free during parachute opening shock. Everything heavy that wasn't strapped to the body was at risk: machine gun components, mortar parts, bazooka rockets, radios, extra ammunition, demolition charges.

### 2. Equipment Bundle Losses
Crew-served weapons and heavy supplies were dropped in separate equipment bundles (door bundles or para-packs). These had to be located after landing. In the dark, in unfamiliar terrain, with Germans nearby, finding bundles was often impossible. Many landed in flooded fields and sank.

### 3. Personal Gear Scattered on Landing
Hard landings in hedgerows, trees, flooded areas, and rooftops caused paratroopers to abandon gear during emergency escapes from harnesses. Men who landed in water cut themselves free and lost everything not in their pockets.

**What paratroopers reliably kept:**
- Weapon in hand or strapped to body (rifle, carbine, Thompson)
- Ammunition on their belt and bandoliers
- Grenades in pockets
- Knife, compass, cricket, first aid packet
- K-rations in jacket pockets

**What was commonly lost:**
- Machine guns and tripods
- Mortars and mortar rounds
- Bazooka rockets (launchers sometimes survived)
- Radios (SCR-300)
- Extra ammunition beyond what was on the body
- Gammon bombs and demolition charges
- Maps and specialized equipment

**Game consequence:** The opening missions of any D-Day airborne scenario should reflect this. Players start with degraded loadouts — rifles and grenades, maybe a BAR, probably no machine gun, no radio, mixed-unit scratch teams. Building combat power means finding equipment bundles, linking up with other units, and improvising.
