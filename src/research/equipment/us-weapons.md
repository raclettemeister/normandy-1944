## M1 Garand Rifle

The backbone of the American rifle squad.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) |
| Weight | 9.5 lbs (4.3 kg) unloaded |
| Effective range | 500 yards (457 m) |
| Rate of fire | 16–24 aimed rounds/min |
| Feed | 8-round en-bloc clip |
| Muzzle velocity | 2,800 fps (853 m/s) |
| Overall length | 43.6 inches |

**The en-bloc clip and "ping":** The clip ejects with a distinctive metallic *ping* when the last round fires. Experienced German soldiers listened for it. In gameplay, the ping is a real audio cue — enemies near enough to hear it know you're reloading. Soldiers sometimes threw empty clips to bait enemies into exposing themselves.

**Tactical significance:** Semi-automatic fire gives a massive advantage over the German Kar98k bolt-action. A Garand-armed rifleman can put out roughly double the aimed fire of his German counterpart. At the squad level, this means American rifle squads generate far more suppressive fire from their riflemen alone, freeing the BAR man for concentrated fire on key targets. The Garand defines the American infantry advantage at 100–400 yards: sustained, accurate, rapid semi-auto fire.

**Limitation:** The 8-round clip cannot be topped off mid-clip without ejecting remaining rounds. Soldiers learned to fire the clip dry, reload, and keep going. In-game, this creates a micro-decision: fire the last rounds or swap now?

## M1 Carbine

The lightweight alternative for officers, NCOs, radiomen, and specialists.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | .30 Carbine (7.62×33mm) |
| Weight | 5.5 lbs (2.5 kg) unloaded |
| Effective range | 300 yards (274 m) |
| Rate of fire | Semi-auto, ~30 aimed rounds/min |
| Feed | 15-round detachable magazine (30-round late war) |
| Muzzle velocity | 1,990 fps (607 m/s) |
| Overall length | 35.6 inches |

The M1A1 folding-stock variant was purpose-built for paratroopers — compact enough to jump with. Half the weight of a Garand.

**Tactical significance:** The Carbine trades stopping power and range for portability. Officers and specialists who need to manage their unit rather than serve as primary shooters benefit from the lighter weight. The 15-round magazine is a practical advantage over the Garand's 8-round clip in close-range engagements. However, the .30 Carbine round is significantly weaker than .30-06 — less reliable at stopping power beyond 200 yards, and poor penetration through cover.

**For the platoon leader:** The Carbine-armed leader can move faster and carry more command equipment (maps, binoculars, radio). The trade-off is real: if the fight closes to CQB, the Carbine is adequate. If the fight is at 300+ yards across hedgerow country, the leader wishes he had a Garand.

## Thompson M1A1 Submachine Gun

The close-range firepower weapon.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | .45 ACP (11.43×23mm) |
| Weight | 10.4 lbs (4.7 kg) unloaded |
| Effective range | 50–100 yards practical; 200 yards maximum |
| Rate of fire | 700–800 rpm cyclic; ~80 rpm practical full-auto |
| Feed | 20 or 30-round box magazine |
| Muzzle velocity | 950 fps (290 m/s) |
| Overall length | 31.7 inches |

**Tactical significance:** The Thompson is a hedgerow and building weapon. In the close terrain of Normandy — orchards, villages, sunken lanes — the Thompson gives devastating firepower at 0–75 yards. The .45 ACP round hits hard but drops fast. Past 100 yards it's largely useless for aimed fire.

Typically carried by squad leaders, assistant squad leaders, and scouts — the men most likely to encounter the enemy first at close range.

**Ammo problem:** .45 ACP is heavy. A 30-round magazine weighs about 1.5 lbs. Carrying 6 magazines means 9+ lbs of ammo alone. Thompson men burn through ammunition fast on full-auto. In sustained combat, they run dry before riflemen do.

**For the platoon leader:** The Thompson dictates squad employment. A Thompson-heavy element excels at clearing buildings, ambushes, and night fighting. It struggles in open terrain where Germans can engage at 200+ yards with impunity. Assign Thompson carriers to assault elements, not base-of-fire elements.

## BAR — Browning Automatic Rifle (M1918A2)

The squad's base of fire. One per rifle squad.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) |
| Weight | 16.5 lbs (7.5 kg) empty; 18 lbs loaded |
| Effective range | 600 yards (548 m) |
| Rate of fire | Slow auto: 300–450 rpm; Fast auto: 500–650 rpm |
| Feed | 20-round detachable box magazine |
| Muzzle velocity | 2,800 fps (853 m/s) |
| Overall length | 47.8 inches |

The M1918A2 fired only in automatic — two selectable rates, no semi-auto. Equipped with a bipod for prone fire.

**Tactical significance:** The BAR is the most important weapon in the rifle squad. It provides the sustained automatic fire that pins enemies while riflemen maneuver. American "fire and movement" doctrine revolves around the BAR: the BAR team suppresses, the maneuver team flanks.

**Critical weakness — 20-round magazine:** Compared to the German MG-42's belt feed, the BAR's 20-round magazine is a severe limitation. At 450 rpm, that's under 3 seconds of fire. The BAR man and his assistant (who carries extra magazines) must manage ammunition carefully. Barrel changes are not practical in the field. Overheating is a real risk during prolonged engagements.

**For the platoon leader:** Losing the BAR man cripples the squad's firepower. Protect the BAR team. Position them where they have clear fields of fire at 200–500 yards. Never let the BAR team get caught in a CQB fight where its slow magazine changes become lethal. The BAR assistant carrying 12+ extra magazines is as important as the gunner.

## M1919A4 .30 Caliber Machine Gun

The platoon's heavy automatic weapon. Crew-served (2–3 men).

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) |
| Weight | 31 lbs gun + 14 lbs tripod (45 lbs total) |
| Effective range | 1,000+ yards; max 1,500 yards |
| Rate of fire | 400–550 rpm cyclic; ~150 rpm sustained |
| Feed | 250-round fabric or disintegrating belt |
| Muzzle velocity | 2,800 fps (853 m/s) |

**Tactical significance:** Belt-fed, tripod-mounted, and capable of sustained fire — the M1919 is the platoon leader's answer to the German MG-42. It can suppress positions at ranges where BARs and rifles struggle. On a tripod with T&E mechanism, it delivers accurate beaten-zone fire across hedgerow gaps and open fields.

**Airborne problem:** 45+ lbs of gun and tripod, plus ammunition (a 250-round belt weighs ~17 lbs). Paratroopers had to jump with this gear or recover it from equipment bundles — which were frequently lost in the drop. Many platoons fought on D-Day without their M1919s.

**For the platoon leader:** When you have it, the M1919 anchors your defense. Dig it in, give it interlocking fields of fire, and it dominates. When you don't have it (common on D-Day), you're relying on BARs and Garands against belt-fed MG-42s. That's a losing equation at range.

## M1911A1 Pistol

Officer and NCO sidearm.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | .45 ACP |
| Weight | 2.5 lbs empty; 3 lbs loaded |
| Effective range | 25–50 yards |
| Feed | 7-round magazine |
| Muzzle velocity | 830 fps (253 m/s) |
| Overall length | 8.6 inches |

**Tactical significance:** Minimal. The M1911 is a last-resort weapon, not a primary combat tool. Officers carry it because they're armed with carbines or Thompsons as primary weapons. In building clearing or point-blank encounters, the .45 ACP is lethal. Past 25 yards, it's unreliable for anything but suppressive noise.

**For the platoon leader:** If you're shooting your pistol, something has gone very wrong. It matters only in ambush scenarios, building clearing, or when your primary weapon is empty. Its real value is psychological — having *something* when everything else fails.

## M3 Trench Knife / Fighting Knife

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Blade length | 6.75 inches |
| Overall length | 11.75 inches |
| Weight | ~1.2 lbs with sheath |

Paratroopers also carried the M2 switchblade in a collar pocket for cutting parachute lines if snagged in trees.

**Tactical significance:** Silent killing for sentry removal and close combat. On D-Day night drops, scattered paratroopers sometimes encountered lone Germans at knife range. The trench knife also served as a utility tool — cutting wire, prying, digging.

**For the platoon leader:** Knives matter only in stealth scenarios. If your men are using knives, they're either executing a planned silent approach or they're in desperate trouble.

## M1A1 Bazooka (2.36-inch Rocket Launcher)

The squad-level anti-armor weapon.

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Caliber | 2.36 inches (60mm) |
| Weight | ~16 lbs (7.2 kg) |
| Effective range | 100–120 yards practical; 400 yards max |
| Rate of fire | ~10 rounds/min |
| Penetration | 3–4 inches of armor plate |
| Crew | 2 (gunner + loader) |

**Tactical significance:** The Bazooka gives paratroopers a chance against armored vehicles — but only barely. Effective range of ~100 yards means the crew must get dangerously close. Penetration is marginal against the frontal armor of heavier German tanks (Panther, Tiger) but effective against halftracks, armored cars, and the sides/rear of medium tanks. Also devastating against fortified positions, bunkers, and buildings.

**Airborne problem:** Rockets are heavy and bulky. A two-man team carrying the launcher and 3–6 rockets is already burdened. On D-Day, many bazooka teams were separated from their ammunition bundles.

**For the platoon leader:** The Bazooka is your only organic anti-armor capability. Position the team on likely vehicle approaches with flanking shots (side armor is thinner). Never commit them frontally against heavy armor. They're also your best tool for cracking a fortified position at short range. Protect this team — losing them means your platoon is helpless against vehicles.

## Weapon Mix: What a Paratrooper Rifle Squad Looks Like

A typical 101st Airborne rifle squad (12 men) on D-Day:

| Role | Weapon | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Squad leader | Thompson M1A1 or M1 Carbine | Command + close-range firepower |
| Assistant squad leader | Thompson M1A1 or M1 Garand | Leads maneuver element |
| BAR man | BAR M1918A2 | Squad's automatic weapon |
| BAR assistant | M1 Garand | Carries extra BAR magazines |
| Rifleman ×8 | M1 Garand | Core of the squad's firepower |

After the drop, squads were rarely at full strength. Leaders assembled ad-hoc groups from whoever they could find — often mixing men from different companies and even regiments. Weapon distribution in these scratch groups was unpredictable.

**The fundamental asymmetry:** An American rifle squad has 1 automatic weapon (BAR, 20 rounds). A German squad has 1–2 belt-fed MG-42s (250+ rounds belted). The American advantage is semi-auto rifles. The German advantage is concentrated automatic fire. This asymmetry drives every firefight in the game.
