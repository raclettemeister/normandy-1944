# Fire and Maneuver — Small Unit Infantry Tactics, 1944

Reference material for game content authors. Based on FM 7-10 (Rifle Company, Rifle Regiment), FM 21-75, and historical accounts of US infantry combat in the European Theater.

## The Core Principle

Fire and maneuver is the fundamental building block of infantry combat. One element shoots to suppress the enemy (base of fire). The other element moves to a position of advantage (maneuver element). Then they switch. This leapfrog continues until the maneuver element is close enough to assault the enemy position.

FM 7-10 defines maneuver as: *"Movement supported by fire to gain a position of advantage over the enemy."*

Everything in this document derives from that single idea.

## The 1944 Rifle Squad: 12 Men

### Organization

| Role | Rank | Weapon | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| Squad Leader | Staff Sergeant | M1 Garand, M1911 pistol | Commands the squad. Directs fire and movement |
| Assistant Squad Leader | Sergeant | M1 Garand + rifle grenades | Second in command. Leads the maneuver element or the assault |
| Automatic Rifleman | Private/PFC | M1918A2 BAR | Provides the squad's automatic fire |
| Assistant Automatic Rifleman | Private/PFC | M1 Garand | Feeds BAR, carries spare magazines, replaces gunner if hit |
| Ammunition Bearer | Private/PFC | M1 Garand | Carries extra BAR magazines and mortar ammo |
| Scout (×2) | Private/PFC | M1 Garand | Move ahead of squad. Find the enemy. Report |
| Rifleman (×5) | Private/PFC | M1 Garand | General-purpose fighters |

**Total**: 12 men, 1 BAR, 10 M1 Garands, 1 set of rifle grenades.

The **BAR team** (automatic rifleman + assistant + ammo bearer) is the squad's firepower core. The remaining men form the **rifle team**, led by the assistant squad leader.

### Airborne Variation

Airborne squads in the 506th PIR followed the same basic organization but often carried additional grenades, fewer anti-tank grenades, and sometimes an extra BAR acquired from casualties or supply bundles. Airborne troopers also carried the M1A1 folding-stock carbine more commonly than line infantry.

## The BAR: The Squad's Fire Engine

### Specifications

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Caliber | .30-06 Springfield |
| Magazine | 20-round detachable box |
| Rate of fire (slow auto) | 300-450 rpm |
| Rate of fire (fast auto) | 500-650 rpm |
| Practical sustained rate | 40-60 rpm (2-3 round bursts every 2-3 seconds) |
| Effective range | 550 meters (point targets), 600+ meters (area targets) |
| Weight (loaded) | ~9 kg (20 lbs) |

### Tactical Employment

The BAR's job is suppression — keeping enemy heads down so the rifle team can move. Key principles:

- **Short bursts**: 2-3 rounds per trigger pull. Longer bursts waste ammunition and cause the barrel to rise
- **Beaten zone**: The BAR man fires at a specific area (window, hedgerow gap, foxhole line), not at individual targets. The goal is to make that area lethal to occupy
- **Ammunition management**: With only 20 rounds per magazine, the BAR goes through ammo fast. The assistant and ammo bearer carry 12 additional magazines (240 rounds total for the team). At sustained fire rates, this lasts 4-6 minutes of continuous engagement
- **Position changes**: After every 2-3 magazines, the BAR team should shift position 5-10 meters laterally. Enemy will have located them by muzzle flash and sound
- **Bipod discipline**: The M1918A2 has a bipod. Used from prone or behind low cover, it dramatically improves accuracy. Standing/kneeling fire is for emergencies only

### Game Design Note

The BAR creates an ammunition tension for the player. It's the squad's most effective weapon for suppression, but it burns through magazines fast. The player must decide when to use it (save it for the assault? or suppress now and hope resupply comes?). Each burst is a resource expenditure.

## How a Squad Attacks a Position

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment

1. Scouts (moving 50-100m ahead of the squad) detect the enemy position — by sight, sound, or being fired upon
2. Scouts hit the ground and report back: **enemy location, strength, weapons, and cover**
3. Squad leader assesses: Can we bypass? Must we attack? Can we get support from the platoon?

### Phase 2: Deployment

4. Squad leader designates a **base of fire position** — ground with cover and a clear line of sight to the enemy. Usually a hedgerow, ditch, stone wall, or fold in the ground
5. **BAR team** (3 men) plus 1-2 riflemen move to the base of fire position
6. **Maneuver element** (assistant squad leader + remaining riflemen, typically 5-6 men) prepares to move

### Phase 3: Suppression

7. On the squad leader's signal, the base of fire opens up. The BAR delivers sustained bursts. Riflemen fire aimed shots at identified positions
8. The goal is **fire superiority** — the enemy is pinned, unable to effectively aim or move. Indicators: enemy fire becomes sporadic, inaccurate, or stops
9. The base of fire does NOT need to kill the enemy. It needs to force them to keep their heads down for 30-90 seconds at a time

### Phase 4: Maneuver

10. The maneuver element moves laterally and forward, using covered routes (dead ground, ditches, hedgerow lines) to approach the enemy flank or rear
11. Movement is by **bounds**: one man or fire team moves 15-30 meters while the rest cover. Then the next element moves
12. The maneuver element aims for a position within **grenade range** (30-40 meters) of the enemy, ideally on their flank

### Phase 5: Assault

13. The maneuver element signals the base of fire to **shift fire** (move their aim away from the assault path, or cease fire entirely)
14. The assault element throws grenades — 2-3 fragmentation grenades into the enemy position
15. Immediately after detonation (1-2 seconds), the assault element charges into the position, firing from the hip or short halts
16. The assault is **violent, fast, and continuous**. Hesitation at this point is lethal
17. The base of fire watches for enemy attempting to flee or reinforce

### Phase 6: Consolidation

18. The squad leader moves to the captured position
19. Men are repositioned to defend against counterattack (expect one within 5-30 minutes)
20. Casualties are assessed. Ammunition is redistributed. Captured weapons are collected
21. The squad leader reports to the platoon leader: position taken, casualties, enemy killed/captured, ammunition status

### Typical Engagement Distances

| Phase | Distance to Enemy |
|---|---|
| Detection | 100-300 meters |
| Base of fire established | 100-200 meters |
| Maneuver begins | 100-200 meters, closing |
| Grenades thrown | 25-40 meters |
| Assault | 0-25 meters |

## Bounding Overwatch

Bounding overwatch is the method for moving a squad when enemy contact is likely but not yet made. It is slower than traveling but provides immediate fire response.

### Successive Bounds

1. The squad splits into two elements (BAR team + half the riflemen / assistant squad leader + remaining riflemen)
2. **Element A** takes up a covered position with weapons ready
3. **Element B** moves forward past Element A to the next covered position (typically 50-100 meters)
4. Element B halts, takes up firing positions
5. Element A now moves forward past Element B
6. Repeat

### Alternating Bounds

Same as successive, but the moving element stops at a position roughly even with (not past) the overwatching element. This is faster but provides less forward observation.

### Key Distances

- **Bound length**: 50-100 meters in open terrain, 25-50 meters in close terrain (bocage)
- **Interval between elements**: Close enough that the overwatching element can effectively suppress threats to the moving element. In hedgerow country, this often means just one field-length apart (100-200 meters)
- **Time per bound**: 30-60 seconds of movement, 15-30 seconds to set up

### When to Use Bounding Overwatch

- Moving through terrain where you **expect** contact but haven't made it yet
- Approaching a known enemy area
- Moving through ambush-likely terrain (sunken lanes, hedgerow gaps, village outskirts)

### Game Design Note

Bounding overwatch is a player choice about speed vs. security. It halves movement speed but means the squad is never caught in the open without a covering element. The player trades time for survivability.

## Suppressive Fire: Principles

Suppressive fire does not need to hit the enemy. It needs to make the enemy **believe** that exposing themselves will get them hit.

### What Makes Suppression Effective

1. **Volume**: Enough rounds hitting near the target that random chance makes exposure dangerous. A single rifleman cannot suppress effectively. The BAR plus 2-3 riflemen can
2. **Accuracy**: Rounds must land close to the enemy position. Firing wildly into the air suppresses nothing. Aim at the position, even if you can't see a specific target
3. **Consistency**: Gaps in fire allow the enemy to pop up, aim, and fire. Suppression must be sustained (though not continuous — planned overlapping bursts work)
4. **Credibility**: The enemy must believe they will be hit. Early accurate shots establish credibility. After that, even near-misses maintain it

### Ammunition Cost of Suppression

Suppressing a single enemy position for 1 minute requires approximately:

| Weapon | Rounds per minute | Magazines |
|---|---|---|
| BAR | 40-60 | 2-3 magazines |
| M1 Garand | 15-20 aimed | 2-3 clips |
| Combined squad (BAR + 3 rifles) | 85-120 | — |

At this rate, a squad's basic ammunition load supports approximately 5-8 minutes of sustained suppressive fire before resupply is critical.

## Squad Formations

### Column Formation

```
        Scout
          |
        Scout
          |
     Squad Leader
          |
     BAR Gunner
          |
     Asst. BAR
          |
     Ammo Bearer
          |
      Rifleman
          |
      Rifleman
          |
      Rifleman
          |
      Rifleman
          |
      Rifleman
          |
   Asst. Squad Leader
```

**When to use**: Default movement formation. Good control (squad leader can communicate with everyone). Provides some depth against frontal fire. Poor frontal firepower — only the scouts and point can engage forward.

**Spacing**: 3-5 meters between men in close terrain (bocage, woods). 10-15 meters in open terrain.

### Wedge Formation

```
          Scout
         /     \
      Scout   Rifleman
       /         \
  BAR Team    Rifle Team
     (SL in center)
```

**When to use**: Open terrain where contact direction is uncertain. Provides firepower to the front and both flanks. Good dispersion against artillery. Harder to control than column.

**Spacing**: 10-15 meters between men.

### Line Formation (Skirmish Line)

```
Scout - Scout - BAR - Asst - Ammo - SL - Rifle - Rifle - Rifle - Rifle - Rifle - ASL
```

**When to use**: The assault formation. Maximum frontal firepower. Used only for the final approach and assault on an objective. Poor flank security. Difficult to control.

**Spacing**: 3-5 meters between men.

### File Formation

```
Scout → Scout → SL → BAR → Asst → Ammo → Rifle → Rifle → Rifle → Rifle → Rifle → ASL
```

**When to use**: Very restrictive terrain only — trails, narrow lanes between hedgerows, single-file paths through minefields. Maximum control, minimum firepower in any direction. Extremely vulnerable to fire along the length of the file.

**Spacing**: 2-3 meters between men (touch distance in darkness).

## Formations: Decision Matrix for Game Design

| Situation | Formation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Moving on a road or trail | Column | Control, depth |
| Moving across open fields | Wedge | All-around security |
| Moving through hedgerow gaps | File | Terrain forces it |
| Approaching known enemy position | Column → Wedge | Transition as terrain opens |
| Assaulting a position | Line | Maximum firepower forward |
| Moving through village streets | Column or file | Buildings channelize movement |
| Night movement | File or column (tight) | Visual/touch contact required |
| Expecting flanking fire | Echelon (left or right) | Refused flank toward threat |

## Common Mistakes (Historical)

These errors cost American squads heavily in Normandy and should inform "bad outcome" branches in the game:

1. **Bunching up** under fire. Natural instinct, lethal result. One mortar round or MG burst hits multiple men
2. **Assaulting without suppression**. Charging a position that hasn't been suppressed results in heavy casualties from aimed fire
3. **Stopping in the kill zone**. When an ambush hits, some men freeze. Doctrine demands immediate action: assault into the ambush or break contact
4. **Losing the BAR early**. If the BAR gunner is hit and nobody grabs the weapon, the squad loses its suppressive capability
5. **Failing to shift fire**. The base of fire keeps shooting while the assault element enters the beaten zone. Friendly fire casualties
6. **No consolidation**. Taking a position and then standing around celebrating instead of immediately preparing for counterattack
