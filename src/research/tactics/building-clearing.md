## Context: WW2 Building Clearing vs. Modern CQB

Modern Close Quarters Battle (CQB) doctrine — numbered positions, dynamic room entry, "stack and clear" — did not exist in 1944. What soldiers had was a rougher, more brutal set of principles learned through trial and lethal error:

- **Grenades before bodies.** Always throw something in before going in yourself
- **Speed kills — but so does recklessness.** Move fast through danger areas, but know what you're moving into
- **Use the building against itself.** Go through walls, not doors. Come from the top down, not the bottom up
- **Accept that buildings are death traps.** Every room is an unknown. Every doorway is a kill zone

The procedures below reflect what US infantry actually did, not what a modern manual would prescribe.

## The Approach: Getting to the Building

### Suppression

Before anyone moves toward a building, the rest of the squad or platoon suppresses it:

1. **BAR and riflemen** fire at every window, door, and loophole on the side facing the assault team
2. **Rifle grenades** are fired into upper-story windows if possible (creates casualties and confusion inside)
3. If available, a **machine gun** from the platoon weapons section pins down defenders
4. The goal: force anyone inside to get away from windows and openings for 30-60 seconds

### The Approach Route

- **Never approach from the front door.** The front of any building in a village is likely covered by fire from adjacent buildings
- **Use dead ground**: Walls, garden hedges, ditches, rubble piles — anything that breaks line of sight to the building and adjacent positions
- **Smoke**: If available, a smoke grenade between the assault team and adjacent enemy positions buys critical seconds of concealment
- **Speed**: The last 10-20 meters to the building must be covered at a sprint. This is the most dangerous moment — you are in the open, close to the building, committed

### Stacking on the Wall

Once at the building wall:

1. The assault team (4-6 men) presses flat against the exterior wall, on either side of the chosen entry point
2. Stay **below window level**. A defender firing through a window shoots outward and downward — anyone standing upright next to the wall is in the beaten zone
3. Assign roles:
   - **Grenadier**: The man who throws the grenade
   - **First man in**: Enters immediately after detonation, goes left or right (predetermined)
   - **Second man**: Enters and goes opposite direction
   - **Rear security**: Watches the outside — enemy may try to flank or fire from adjacent buildings

## Entry Techniques

### Technique 1: Grenade and Enter (Standard)

This is the default WW2 method for entering a room or building where enemy presence is suspected.

1. Grenadier pulls the pin on a fragmentation grenade (Mk 2 "pineapple")
2. Counts "one-one thousand" (letting the fuse cook for 1 second — reducing the enemy's time to throw it back)
3. Tosses the grenade through the window or door opening. Low and hard — it should bounce and roll to the center of the room
4. Grenadier and everyone nearby press flat against the wall, mouths open (reduces blast pressure on eardrums)
5. **BANG.** 1-2 seconds after detonation, the first man enters
6. First man moves to one side of the room (typically the side with most space), weapon up, scanning opposite corner
7. Second man enters and moves to the other side
8. Both men fire at any threat: enemy soldiers, movement, anything that isn't clearly friendly

**Timing**: From grenade throw to room clear: 4-8 seconds.

**Risks**:
- Grenade bounces back out (smooth floors, bad throw). Lethal to the assault team
- Room has a connecting door — grenade blast alerts occupants of adjacent rooms. They are now ready
- Structural damage — grenade in a room with ammunition or fuel creates a larger explosion
- Friendly casualties in rooms above or below from fragmentation through wooden floors

### Technique 2: Mousehole Entry

Instead of going through doors (which are natural kill zones and often booby-trapped), infantry in Aachen and other urban fights learned to go through walls.

1. Place an explosive charge (TNT block, satchel charge, or multiple grenades taped together) against an interior or exterior wall
2. Blow the hole. Creates an entry point 1-2 meters wide
3. Throw a grenade through the new hole
4. Enter through the hole after detonation

**Advantages**: The enemy has prepared to defend doors and windows. A hole in the wall comes from an unexpected direction. The defender has their weapon oriented toward the door — the entry comes from 90 degrees off their expected axis.

**WW2 application**: At Aachen, soldiers blew holes between row houses and advanced building-to-building without ever stepping into the street. This "tunneling" technique dramatically reduced casualties from street-level machine gun and sniper fire.

### Technique 3: Top-Down Clearing

When possible, WW2 doctrine preferred clearing buildings from the top down:

1. Gain access to the roof or upper floor (ladder, adjacent building, blown hole in upper wall)
2. Clear downward floor by floor
3. Defenders on lower floors expect the attack from below. Coming from above catches them oriented the wrong way

**Why top-down is better**: Gravity helps — grenades roll downstairs. Sound and dust fall down, confusing defenders below. The assault team holds the high ground and can retreat upward if needed.

**Practical limitation**: Getting to the top is the hard part. In Normandy, most farm buildings were 2 stories with steep slate roofs. Access to the upper floor typically meant an interior staircase (a lethal chokepoint) or climbing an exterior wall.

## Clearing a Two-Story Norman Farmhouse: Step by Step

### The Scenario

A stone farmhouse, 2 stories, with a courtyard wall. Ground floor: large room (kitchen/living), smaller room (storage), and a rear door leading to the farmyard. Upper floor: 2 bedrooms, accessed by a narrow wooden staircase. Walls are 50-70 cm thick stone — effectively bulletproof. Windows are small, deep-set.

### The Assault (One Reinforced Squad, ~10 men)

**Setup (30-60 seconds)**:
- Squad Leader positions himself where he can see the building and communicate with both teams
- **Support element** (BAR + 3 riflemen): Takes position 50-75 meters from the building with clear view of the front. Fires at all openings. Keeps enemy heads down
- **Assault element** (Assistant Squad Leader + 5 men): Moves to a covered approach, typically along a garden wall or hedgerow leading to the side or rear of the building

**Phase 1: Approach and Entry (15-30 seconds)**:
1. Support element intensifies fire on the front of the building
2. Assault team sprints to the building wall (side or rear)
3. Presses against the wall below window level. Quick headcount — everyone present
4. Grenadier moves to the rear door (or a ground-floor window)

**Phase 2: Ground Floor (30-60 seconds)**:
5. Grenade through rear door or window into the main ground-floor room
6. After detonation: first two men enter. Move to opposite sides. Engage any threats
7. Third man enters, covers the staircase (the most dangerous point in the building)
8. Fourth man clears the smaller ground-floor room (grenade if blind corner exists, or quick visual check if room is small and open)
9. Rear door is secured — one man watches the farmyard

**Phase 3: Staircase (15-30 seconds)**:
10. The staircase is the critical danger point. In a stone farmhouse, it's typically narrow (1 person wide), turns 90-180 degrees, with a landing
11. One man covers up the staircase from below. Another prepares a grenade
12. Grenade is thrown up the staircase, bouncing off the wall to roll onto the upper landing
13. After detonation, the first man goes up fast, weapon ready, pressing against the wall
14. At the top landing: he turns and engages any visible threat. Second man is right behind

**Phase 4: Upper Floor (30-60 seconds)**:
15. Each bedroom is cleared the same way: grenade through the door, enter after detonation
16. Check under beds, behind furniture, in wardrobes (German soldiers hid in all of these)
17. Upper windows are checked — do they overlook friendly positions? If so, mark them (hang cloth or signal to the support element)

**Phase 5: Consolidation (2-5 minutes)**:
18. "Building clear!" shouted or signaled to the support element
19. Support element ceases fire on the building, shifts to watching adjacent structures
20. Assault team sets up defensive positions inside:
    - BAR moves inside, positioned at a window covering the likely enemy approach
    - Upper floor windows become observation posts
    - Staircase is covered from above (natural chokepoint if enemy tries to retake)
21. Casualties are treated. Ammunition is redistributed. Enemy dead are checked for intelligence (maps, documents, unit insignia)

### Time: Total Clearing Time

For a 2-story farmhouse with light resistance (2-4 defenders): **3-8 minutes** from initial suppression to consolidation.

For a strongly defended building requiring multiple entry attempts: **15-30 minutes**, with higher casualties.

## The Dangers

### The Fatal Funnel

Any doorway is a "fatal funnel" — a narrow space where the defender knows exactly where to aim. The entering soldier is silhouetted against the light behind them and moving from a wide space (hallway) into the narrow frame. WW2 soldiers died in doorways more than anywhere else in urban combat.

**Mitigation**: Enter fast. Never stop in a doorway. Never stand in a doorway to look around. Go through it and immediately move to the side.

### Booby Traps

German forces in Normandy and later in Germany itself extensively booby-trapped buildings:

- **Trip wires** at ankle height across doorways, connected to grenades with pins pulled
- **Pressure plates** under loose floorboards or rugs
- **Door traps**: Wire attached to a door, connected to a charge. Opening the door pulls the pin
- **Attractive objects**: Souvenirs, weapons, or food placed as bait with hidden triggers

**Mitigation**: Never open a door by turning the handle — push it open from the side using a rifle butt or boot. Check thresholds visually before stepping through. If a room looks "too clean" or has obvious items placed in the open, suspect a trap.

### Friendly Fire

In the smoke, dust, and confusion of building clearing, friendly fire was common:

- Men on different floors firing through wooden floors/ceilings
- The support element firing into rooms now occupied by friendly forces
- Assault teams from different squads entering the same building from different sides

**Mitigation**: Pre-assign entry directions. Use verbal signals ("Coming in left!" or "Ground floor clear!"). The support element must have clear communication with the assault team about when to cease fire.

### Structural Collapse

Stone buildings in Normandy were sturdy, but sustained fire from tanks, bazookas, or artillery could bring down walls and ceilings. Soldiers inside a collapsing building had little chance of survival.

**Mitigation**: Before committing troops, assess structural damage from the outside. Avoid buildings already heavily damaged by shelling. If the building starts to crack or groan, evacuate immediately.

### Grenades in Enclosed Spaces

A fragmentation grenade in a stone-walled room produces devastating fragmentation — stone splinters add to the shrapnel. Concussion effects in enclosed spaces can incapacitate even around corners. Soldiers on the same floor as a grenade detonation may be stunned or deafened even with wall protection.

**Mitigation**: Always press against the thickest wall available. Mouth open. Cover ears if possible. Accept that the first man into a room after grenade detonation will be operating with reduced hearing for minutes afterward.

## Game Design Implications

### Building Clearing as Player Decision Tree

Each phase of building clearing offers meaningful player choices:

| Decision Point | Options | Tradeoffs |
|---|---|---|
| Suppress or rush? | Full suppression (slow, ammo cost) vs. surprise rush (fast, more casualties) | Time and ammo vs. casualties |
| Entry point | Front door (expected) vs. side/rear (better) vs. mousehole (best, needs explosives) | Speed vs. surprise vs. resources |
| Grenade or save it? | Grenade every room (safest, uses grenades fast) vs. selective use (saves grenades, higher risk) | Grenade supply vs. clearing speed |
| Top-down or bottom-up? | Top-down (ideal but requires access route) vs. bottom-up (default, harder) | Time to gain upper access vs. tactical advantage |
| How many men commit? | Full squad (thorough) vs. fire team (preserves reserve) | Thoroughness vs. flexibility |
| What to do with captured building? | Fortify and hold (costs men) vs. clear and move on (saves men, loses position) | Position vs. manpower |

### Casualty Expectations

Building clearing is the most casualty-intensive infantry operation. Historical rates from the ETO:

- **Light resistance** (1-2 defenders): 0-1 friendly casualties expected per building
- **Moderate resistance** (3-6 defenders): 1-3 friendly casualties expected
- **Strong resistance** (fortified, prepared defenders): 2-5+ friendly casualties expected, or the building is bypassed and reduced by supporting weapons
