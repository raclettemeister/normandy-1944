## Context: Why Patrolling Matters

In the game, the player must make decisions based on incomplete information. Patrols are the primary tool for reducing that uncertainty. Every time the player sends men forward to scout, they risk lives for information. Every time they don't, they risk walking the entire platoon into an ambush.

Patrolling is the bridge between ignorance and action.

## Patrol Types

### 1. Reconnaissance Patrol

**Mission**: Gather information and return. Avoid contact if possible.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Size | 2-6 men (smaller = stealthier) |
| Composition | Squad leader or experienced NCO + scouts + 1-2 riflemen for security |
| Weapons | Personal weapons only. No BAR (too heavy, too loud). Grenades for emergency break-contact only |
| Duration | 30 minutes to several hours, depending on distance and mission |
| Key rule | **Do not engage unless forced to.** Information is more valuable than a firefight |

**What a recon patrol gathers**:
- Enemy locations (positions, foxholes, vehicles, weapons)
- Enemy strength (how many men, what weapons)
- Enemy activity (digging in? moving? sleeping? alert?)
- Terrain (routes, obstacles, cover, dead ground)
- Routes for the main body to use or avoid

**Reporting format** (SALUTE):
- **S**ize: How many enemy
- **A**ctivity: What they're doing
- **L**ocation: Where they are (grid reference or terrain description)
- **U**nit: What unit (if identifiable from insignia, vehicle markings, equipment)
- **T**ime: When observed
- **E**quipment: What weapons and vehicles observed

### 2. Combat Patrol

**Mission**: Engage the enemy for a specific purpose — ambush, raid, or security.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Size | Squad-strength (8-12 men) or reinforced squad |
| Composition | Full squad with BAR, possibly attached machine gun or mortar team |
| Weapons | Full combat load. Extra grenades. Extra ammunition |
| Duration | 1-4 hours |
| Key rule | **Accomplish the mission and return.** This is not a general advance — it's a specific task |

**Combat patrol subtypes**:

- **Ambush patrol**: Move to a predetermined location, set up a kill zone, wait for enemy movement along a road or trail. Engage with overwhelming firepower, then withdraw before the enemy can react
- **Raid patrol**: Attack a specific enemy position (machine gun nest, observation post, supply point). Destroy it and withdraw. Speed is critical — in and out in minutes, not hours
- **Security patrol**: Move through an area to deny it to enemy patrols. Establish presence. Drive off or destroy any enemy scouts operating near friendly lines

### 3. Standing Patrol

**Mission**: Occupy a position between friendly and enemy lines. Observe and report. Engage enemy patrols attempting to cross the area.

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Size | Fire team (4-5 men) |
| Position | 200-500 meters forward of the main defensive line |
| Duration | 4-8 hours (typically overnight) |
| Key rule | **Hold position and report.** Withdraw only if about to be overrun or when recalled |

Standing patrols differ from LP/OPs in that they are expected to fight, not just observe. They carry full ammunition and are positioned to cover a specific gap or approach.

## Sending a Scout: Individual Scouting Procedure

### Who Gets Sent

The two designated scouts in each squad are trained for forward reconnaissance. They operate in pairs (one moves, one watches) or singly when the situation demands.

**Qualities of a good scout** (from FM 21-75):
- Physically fit (must move quickly and quietly)
- Good night vision and hearing
- Knowledge of terrain reading (understands what ground features mean tactically)
- Calm under pressure (a panicked scout gives false reports or gives away the patrol)
- Good memory (must remember and report accurately what was seen)

### Individual Scout Movement

From FM 21-75, the fundamentals:

1. **Prepare before moving**: Secure all equipment. Tape dog tags. Remove anything shiny. Darken face and hands with dirt or soot. Leave pack and unnecessary gear behind
2. **Move from cover to cover**: Identify your next covered position before leaving the current one. The move between positions should take 3-5 seconds — a quick, low rush
3. **Stop, look, listen**: At every covered position, freeze for 10-15 seconds. Scan with eyes and ears. Look for:
   - Movement (the human eye detects motion before shape)
   - Contrasting colors or shapes (straight lines in nature = man-made)
   - Shine or reflection (glass, metal, wet surfaces)
   - Shadows that don't match the terrain
   - Sounds: equipment, voices, engines, digging
4. **Use terrain**: Move along hedgerow bases, in ditches, along stone walls. Never cross an open space without first observing it for 30-60 seconds. When crossing, go at the narrowest point, at maximum speed
5. **Avoid patterns**: Don't always use the same route. Don't always stop at the same type of feature. Predictability is detectable
6. **Track your position**: Maintain compass bearing and pace count. In hedgerow country, count the fields crossed — each field is roughly 100-200 meters across. This allows you to report accurate positions

### Two-Man Scout Team Technique

The standard scouting technique uses two men:

1. **Scout A** advances 20-30 meters to the next covered position while **Scout B** watches from the current position, weapon ready
2. Scout A halts, observes, and signals "clear" (hand signal or pre-arranged click)
3. Scout B advances to Scout A's position or past it to the next cover
4. Repeat

This ensures one man is always stationary and observing while the other moves. If Scout A encounters the enemy, Scout B is in a position to cover his withdrawal or report back.

## Patrol Planning

### The Five-Paragraph Patrol Order

Before any patrol leaves friendly lines, the patrol leader issues an order covering:

1. **Situation**: What is known about the enemy? What are friendly forces doing? What is the terrain like?
2. **Mission**: Exactly what the patrol must accomplish. Specific, measurable. "Determine if the crossroads at grid XY is occupied by enemy forces" — not "go out and have a look around"
3. **Execution**: The route out, the actions at the objective, the route back. Primary and alternate. Rally points designated along the route
4. **Sustainment**: Ammunition, water, medical supplies. What to take, what to leave behind
5. **Command and Signal**: Who is in charge. Succession of command. Radio frequencies and call signs. Recognition signals. Challenge and password

### Route Selection

- **Outbound route**: Should use covered and concealed terrain. Avoid roads and trails (too predictable, possibly mined or ambushed). Move along hedgerow lines, through ditches, along tree lines
- **Return route**: Should be DIFFERENT from the outbound route. If the patrol was detected going out, the enemy may set an ambush on the same path for the return
- **Rally points**: Designated locations where the patrol regroups if scattered by enemy contact. Typically 2-3 rally points along the route:
  - **Initial rally point (IRP)**: Just outside friendly lines. Where the patrol forms up before departing and where scattered members return if contact occurs early
  - **Objective rally point (ORP)**: The last covered position before the objective. The patrol leader makes final observations from here
  - **En route rally points**: At terrain features along the route (distinctive hedgerow intersections, stream crossings, farm buildings)

### Patrol Formations

| Formation | When Used | Spacing |
|---|---|---|
| File (single column) | Night patrols. Restrictive terrain. When control is critical | 3-5 meters between men |
| Wedge | Daylight patrols in open terrain. When contact direction is uncertain | 10-15 meters between men |
| Diamond | Small recon patrols (4-6 men). Provides all-around security | 10 meters between men |
| V-formation | Ambush patrols approaching the kill zone | 5-10 meters between men |

## Actions at the Objective

### For a Reconnaissance Patrol

1. The patrol halts at the **objective rally point** (ORP) — the last covered position with a view of (or near) the objective
2. The patrol leader and 1-2 scouts move forward to observe. The rest remain at the ORP as security
3. **Observe for a set time**: Minimum 15-30 minutes. Record everything: positions, weapons, patrol patterns, alert state, barriers, vehicles
4. **Sketch the position**: A rough diagram showing enemy locations, fields of fire, approach routes, and key terrain. This sketch becomes critical intelligence for planning the assault
5. **Do not engage**. If detected, the patrol leader decides: break contact and withdraw (preferred), or fight through (only if withdrawal is impossible)
6. Return to the ORP. Brief the patrol. Move back to friendly lines via the alternate return route

### For a Combat Patrol (Ambush)

1. The patrol moves to the ambush site well before the expected enemy movement (1-2 hours early)
2. The patrol leader positions the **kill zone**: the section of road or trail where the enemy will be caught
3. **Assault element**: Positioned along one side of the kill zone, weapons covering the entire length
4. **Security element**: Positioned at both ends of the kill zone to prevent escape and warn of unexpected enemy approach
5. **Initiation**: The patrol leader initiates the ambush (usually with a command-detonated mine, grenade, or the first burst of the BAR). All weapons fire simultaneously
6. The ambush lasts 30-60 seconds of intense fire, then:
   - Either: assault through the kill zone (if mission requires prisoners or equipment)
   - Or: cease fire and withdraw immediately (if mission is harassment/disruption)
7. Withdraw via planned route. Move fast. The enemy will send a reaction force

### For a Combat Patrol (Raid)

1. Move to the ORP. Leave security team and any non-essential personnel
2. The assault team moves to a position within striking distance of the objective (50-100 meters)
3. **Support element** (BAR, MG if available) sets up to cover the assault
4. On signal, support element opens fire. Assault element rushes the objective
5. **Time on objective**: Minimum. Destroy what you came to destroy. Grab prisoners/documents if that's the mission. 2-5 minutes maximum
6. Predetermined withdrawal signal (whistle, flare, radio call). Everyone moves to the ORP
7. Account for all personnel. Move back to friendly lines rapidly

## Avoiding Detection

### Movement Discipline

- **Speed**: Move only as fast as silence permits. A patrol that sounds like a herd of cattle will be detected long before visual range. In hedgerow country at night: 0.5-1 km/hr
- **Halts**: Every 100-200 meters, the entire patrol freezes for 15-30 seconds. Listen. Let the natural sounds resume — if birds and insects go quiet when you pass and don't resume, you're moving too fast or too noisily
- **Vegetation**: Avoid pushing through thick brush. Go around. If you must push through, do it slowly — one branch at a time, controlling the release so it doesn't snap back
- **Water crossings**: Wade slowly. Disturbed water reflects light differently. Splashing carries hundreds of meters. Cross at the shallowest, narrowest point

### Counter-Tracking

- **Hard surfaces**: Walk on rocks, packed earth, roads (briefly) when possible. Soft mud shows footprints for days
- **Heel-to-toe**: Step deliberately. Avoid dragging feet, which leaves scuff marks
- **Vary the route**: Don't always use hedgerow gaps. If the enemy knows you use a specific gap, they'll mine it or cover it with a machine gun
- **Disinformation**: Some patrols deliberately leave signs pointing in a false direction before changing course. This is risky (takes time, may not fool a skilled tracker) but can divert enemy attention

### What Gives You Away

| Detection Method | Distance | Countermeasure |
|---|---|---|
| Sound (equipment, footsteps, voices) | 50-300 meters | Noise discipline, slow movement |
| Visual (movement, silhouette) | 50-500 meters (terrain dependent) | Use cover, avoid skylining, camouflage |
| Smell (tobacco, cooking, soap) | 50-200 meters (wind dependent) | No smoking. No soap or cologne. Minimal food |
| Dogs | 500+ meters | Cannot fully counter. Avoid downwind approach. Move through water |
| Trip wires and warning devices | Contact distance | Point man checks with hands/eyes. Move slowly |
| Disturbed wildlife (birds flushing, dogs barking) | Variable | Move slowly. Halt when animals are alarmed. Wait for calm to resume |

## When to Engage vs. When to Withdraw

This is the critical patrol decision, and one of the most important player choices in the game.

### Engage When

- The mission requires it (combat patrol, ambush, raid)
- You have surprise and can destroy the enemy before they react
- The enemy threatens friendly forces and will cause greater harm if not stopped now
- Withdrawal is impossible — you've been detected and the enemy is closing

### Withdraw When

- You are on a reconnaissance mission — your information is more valuable than one firefight
- The enemy outnumbers you significantly and you have a route of withdrawal
- Engaging would reveal the location and activity of your main body
- You can report the enemy position for a larger force to deal with later

### The Decision Framework for Game Design

```
Enemy detected → 
  ├── Are we on a recon mission?
  │     ├── YES → Withdraw and report (unless cornered)
  │     └── NO → Continue assessment
  │
  ├── Do we have surprise?
  │     ├── YES → Engage if mission requires, else still consider withdrawing
  │     └── NO → They see us too. Fight or run, decide NOW
  │
  ├── Can we destroy them quickly?
  │     ├── YES → Engage. Violent action. Then withdraw
  │     └── NO → Break contact. Smoke, covering fire, bound back to rally point
  │
  └── Will engaging compromise the larger mission?
        ├── YES → Withdraw. Report. Let the platoon handle it
        └── NO → Engage at patrol leader's discretion
```

### Break Contact Procedure

When a patrol is detected and must withdraw:

1. **Immediate action**: Nearest man to the enemy opens fire (buys 5-10 seconds). Everyone else drops to cover
2. **Smoke**: If available, throw smoke between the patrol and the enemy
3. **Peel back**: The man nearest the enemy fires a magazine, then runs past the patrol to the rear. The next nearest man takes over firing. Each man leapfrogs backward while the rest cover
4. **Rally point**: The patrol withdraws to the nearest pre-designated rally point. Headcount. Treat wounded. Decide: continue mission or return to friendly lines
5. **Report**: Even a blown patrol provides intelligence — enemy location, strength, alert status, weapons observed

## Information: What to Gather and How to Report

### Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR)

In the game context, the platoon leader needs to know:

1. **Where is the enemy?** Exact positions, not vague areas. "Machine gun position at the northeast corner of the field, 200 meters south of the church" — not "there are Germans somewhere south of town"
2. **How many?** Count helmets, weapons, foxholes. Distinguish between "I saw 5 men" and "I saw a squad-sized position (estimate 8-12 men)"
3. **What weapons?** Rifles only? Machine guns? Mortars? Anti-tank guns? Vehicles? Each weapon type changes the tactical equation
4. **What are they doing?** Digging in (defensive)? Moving (offensive or repositioning)? Sleeping (vulnerable)? This reveals intent
5. **What routes are open?** Can the platoon approach from the east without being seen? Is the road mined? Is the bridge intact?

### Reporting Back

The scout or patrol leader reports directly to the platoon leader (or the player). A good report:

- States facts, not opinions. "I saw 6 men in foxholes" — not "I think there are a lot of them"
- Uses a sketch or map to indicate positions. Drawing in the dirt is acceptable
- Includes time of observation. Information degrades — what was true 30 minutes ago may not be true now
- Flags uncertainty. "I could see the front of the position but not the rear — there may be more men behind the hedgerow"

### Game Design Note

The quality of patrol reports should vary based on who is sent, how long they observe, and whether they are detected. A experienced scout who observes for 20 minutes undetected brings back a detailed sketch. A green replacement who panics and runs back after 2 minutes gives a vague, possibly inaccurate report. The player's intelligence picture is only as good as the patrol they sent to gather it.
