  "narrative": "A stone farmhouse at the edge of a pasture. Two stories, slate roof, barn attached. Paratrooper gear on the front porch — musette bag, helmet with the ace of spades. That's 506th. The door is shut and the windows are dark, but you hear floorboards creaking inside. Someone is in there.",
  "narrativeAlt": {
    "hasSecondInCommand": "A stone farmhouse. Paratrooper gear on the porch — 506th helmet, musette bag. Henderson studies the building for a long moment. 'Could be ours,' he says quietly. He checks his carbine. 'How do you want to handle this, sir?'",
    "solo": "A stone farmhouse alone at the edge of a pasture. Paratrooper gear on the porch — that's 506th, your regiment. Ammo in there, maybe. Equipment. But the windows are dark and you're one man with a pistol."

  "rally": {
    "narrative": "Rivera comes out shaking, but his hands go straight to the aid bag — already checking your men before anyone asks. Kowalski fills the doorway behind him, BAR across his chest, two extra bandoliers over his shoulders. He looks at you and nods once. A medic and an automatic weapon. Everything just changed."

  "decisions": {
    "farmhouse_stack_clear": {
      "text": "Stack on the door — clear the building room by room",
      "success": "Henderson clicks at the door. Two clicks back from inside. He enters low, sweeps left — Rivera standing there with hands raised, Kowalski with the BAR on the doorframe. 'Thunder,' Rivera whispers. Room by room, you clear it. Nothing but your own men.",
      "partial": "Henderson clicks at the door. Silence — Rivera lost his clicker in the drop. 'Flash,' Henderson whispers. A voice comes back shaky: 'Thunder! Don't shoot, we're American!' The door opens to Kowalski's BAR aimed at Henderson's chest. A full minute before anyone stops shaking.",
      "failure": "Doyle catches the milk pail with his boot — it clatters across stone and the BAR opens up through the door. Henderson throws himself flat screaming 'AMERICAN!' until the firing stops. Nobody hit. Close enough to taste."
    },
    "farmhouse_two_element": {
      "text": "Send two men to the front while you cover the back exit",
      "success": "Henderson and Malone take the front. Henderson clicks. Two clicks from inside. 'Friendlies coming in.' The door opens and Henderson's voice carries through the window: 'Clear. Captain, come on in.' Rivera and Kowalski. Alive and armed.",
      "partial": "Henderson and Malone enter. You hear voices — urgent, not gunfire. Then Henderson at the back window: 'Captain, it's ours. Rivera and Kowalski.' But Doyle at the back door heard the commotion and nearly squeezed one off. You had to push his barrel down yourself.",
      "failure": "Henderson enters. Kowalski fires at the movement. Henderson dives. Malone fires back. 'CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIRE!' — Henderson screaming in the dark. When the ringing stops, Malone has a graze on his arm. Nobody dead. Barely."
    },
    "farmhouse_rush": {
      "text": "Go in fast — rush the building before anyone can react",
      "success": "You burst through the door. Rivera screams. Kowalski swings the BAR toward your chest and stops — your helmet silhouette, American. 'JESUS! We're American!' Rivera shouts. Kowalski's finger was on the trigger. One more second.",
      "partial": "You crash through the door. The BAR fires — the round hits the wall an inch from your head, plaster dust in your eyes. 'FLASH! FLASH!' you scream. Kowalski stops. Rivera is on the floor, hands over his ears, crying. Everyone alive, but something in the room is broken.",
      "failure": "You charge in. The BAR fires. One of your men is silhouetted in the doorway and the round takes him off his feet. 'AMERICAN! WE'RE AMERICAN!' Too late. Rivera rushes to the body. Your own soldier, shot by your own people, because you didn't say a word before you came through that door."

    "farmhouse_grenade": {
      "text": "Toss a grenade through the window, then enter",
      "success": "You pull the pin. Henderson grabs your wrist. 'Captain. CAPTAIN. Look at the porch.' His voice is flat, urgent. 'That's 506th gear.' You look. He's right. You work the pin back in with fingers that won't stop trembling. Henderson just saved you from the worst mistake of your life.",
      "partial": "The grenade goes through the window. The blast shakes the walls. You enter through smoke and find Rivera on the floor, ears bleeding, mouth open in a scream you can't hear. Kowalski is dazed against the far wall, the BAR knocked from his hands. Both alive — the grenade landed in the next room. Your medic can't hear you calling his name.",
      "failure": "The grenade detonates in the main room. You go in through the smoke. Kowalski is dead where he sat — the blast caught him square. Rivera is slumped against the far wall, shrapnel in his chest, staring at the screaming eagle on your shoulder. 'You...' he whispers. You just killed your own BAR gunner with a Gammon bomb."

    "farmhouse_clicker_outside": {
      "text": "Use the cricket clicker from the porch — listen for a response",
      "success": "One click-clack from the porch. Silence. Then from inside: click-clack, click-clack. Rivera's voice, muffled: 'American? Please be American.' You open the door. Rivera and Kowalski. Alive, armed, and the relief on Rivera's face nearly breaks you.",
      "partial": "One click. Nothing — Rivera lost his clicker in the drop. You try the verbal: 'Flash.' Long pause. Then a voice through the door, barely audible: 'Thunder.' The door cracks open. Rivera's face, drawn and pale. 'Captain? Oh, thank God.'",
      "failure": "One click. The sound of a weapon being readied inside — a bolt sliding home. No clicker, no response. You call out 'Flash.' A long silence. Then: '...Thunder?' Scared, uncertain. You enter slow. Rivera's hands are shaking so badly he can't hold his aid bag."
    },
    "farmhouse_scout": {
      "text": "Scout the building first — check every window for movement",
      "success": "You circle the building low, back against the stone. Through a side window: two figures in American uniforms. Medic armband on one, the other cradling a BAR. You tap the glass. 'Flash.' 'Thunder!' They let you in through the side door.",
      "partial": "You circle the farmhouse. Dark inside — shapes, nothing clear. But the boots on the floor are American tread, not German hobnail. You tap the door with your clicker and wait. It takes time, but contact is made. Rivera and Kowalski, alive in the dark.",
      "failure": "Twenty-five minutes circling the building on your belly. Shapes through dirty glass, nothing confirmed. You finally use the clicker at the front door and it works in thirty seconds. Half an hour burned for what the clicker would have done from the porch."

    "farmhouse_skip": {
      "text": "Skip the farmhouse — keep moving toward the rally point",
      "success": "You move past the farmhouse without stopping. Henderson glances back once. 'Those were our people, sir.' Maybe. Maybe not. The gear on the porch stays with you longer than it should.",
      "partial": "You push on through the next field. The farmhouse falls behind in the gray. Halfway across, you hear it — a cricket clicker from that direction. One click. Faint. You're already moving and you don't go back.",
      "failure": "You leave. Henderson says nothing but his jaw is set. Malone mutters something you don't catch. You left possible friendlies in a dark farmhouse because you were afraid of what was inside. The men saw it."
