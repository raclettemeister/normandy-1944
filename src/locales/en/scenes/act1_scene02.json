The briefing maps showed the DZ near Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, but that could be anywhere now. You pull the compass from your leg pocket. The luminous dial settles — north. But north of where?"

      "partial": "The compass gives you north, but nothing on the ground matches the briefing. Either the map was wrong or you're further from the DZ than you thought. A direction, not a position.",

      "partial": "You move toward the shooting but the sound bounces off the hedgerows. Fifteen minutes and you're not sure you've walked straight. Then the gunfire stops.",
      "failure": "The noise leads you to the edge of a village — German helmets in the firelight. You freeze, back away, circle wide. Fifteen minutes in the wrong direction."
